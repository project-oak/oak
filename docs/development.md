## Quick Start

To build and run one of the Oak example applications under Docker, run (after
[installing Docker](Docker.md) if necessary):

```bash
./scripts/docker_pull  # retrieve cached Docker image for faster builds
./scripts/docker_run ./scripts/runner --logs run-examples --example-name=hello_world
```

This should build the Runtime, an Oak Application and a client for the
Application, then run them all, with log output ending something like the
following:

```log
[2020-07-24T10:52:39Z INFO  oak_runtime::runtime] stopping node NodeId(2)...done
[2020-07-24T10:52:39Z INFO  oak_loader] Runtime stopped
[2020-07-24T10:52:39Z INFO  oak_runtime::runtime] stopping runtime instance
[2020-07-24T10:52:39Z INFO  oak_runtime::runtime] Runtime instance dropped
 ❯ examples ❯ hello_world ❯ run ❯ background server ⊢ (finished) OK
 ❯ examples ❯ hello_world ❯ run } ⊢ [OK] [34s]
 ❯ examples ❯ hello_world } ⊢ [OK] [143s]
 ❯ examples } ⊢ [OK] [143s]
```

Note: `./scripts/docker_pull` and `./scripts/docker_run` will need `sudo` if not
[configured otherwise](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).

The remainder of this document explores what's going on under the covers here,
allowing individual stages to be built and run independently, and allowing
builds that don't have to rely on a Docker environment.

## VS Code Dev Container

The simplest way to get up and running with a development environment that
contains all the required tools is to use
[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the
[Remote-Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers)
extension. After this is installed, and VS Code is running and pointing to the
root of the Oak repository, from a separate terminal build the Docker image, if
you haven't already:

```bash
./scripts/docker_pull
./scripts/docker_build
```

Then from VS Code click on the Remote-Containers button in the bottom left
corner of the status bar:

![Remote-Containers status bar](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/remote/common/remote-dev-status-bar.png)

and then select "Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container".

This should attach VS Code to an instance of the Docker container with all the
dev tools installed, and configured with most linters and Rust tools.

The Rust-Analyzer extension may prompt you to download the rust-analyzer server,
in which case allow that by clicking on "Download now" in the notification.

To test that things work correctly, open a Rust file, start typing `std::`
somewhere, and autocomplete results should start showing up. Note that it may
take a while for the `rust-analyzer` extension to go through all the local code
and build its index. Alternatively, try `./scripts/runner run-tests`.

On Linux you might have to
[post-installation steps for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)
and run `systemctl start docker`. If you get a `Permission denied` try to
rebuild the Docker images with `./scripts/docker_build`.

## Meta-Advice

For any open-source project, the best way of figuring out what prerequisites and
dependendencies are required is to look at the projects continuous integration
(CI) scripts and configuration.

For Oak, the CI system is currently
[Google Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build), so the top-level
[`cloudbuild.yaml`](/cloudbuild.yaml) file holds the project's definitive
configuration, dependencies and build scripts.

## Docker vs. Native

The Cloudbuild setup for the project relies on a project
[`Dockerfile`](/Dockerfile) to capture precise toolchain dependencies and
versions. This also allows local use of Docker to match this build environment,
using the following wrapper scripts:

- [`scripts/docker_pull`](/scripts/docker_pull) retrieves the project's most
  recent cached Docker image(s).
- [`scripts/docker_run`](/scripts/docker_run) runs its arguments within Docker,
  so can be used as a prefix for any commands described later in this document.
- [`scripts/docker_sh`](/scripts/docker_sh) runs an interactive shell within
  Docker. This can also be used to run any commands described later in this
  document.

If you want to work on the project without using Docker, you should synchronize
your installed versions of all the tools described in the next section with the
versions installed in the [`Dockerfile`](/Dockerfile).

## Prerequisites

The key prerequisites for the project are:

- **Rust**: The [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and
  ancillary tools are required for building the project's source. Note that we
  also [require](https://github.com/project-oak/oak/issues/969) a nightly build
  of Rust; check the [`Dockerfile`](/Dockerfile) for the specific version.
  - Follow install instructions from https://rustup.rs/, roughly:
    - `curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf > /tmp/rustup`
    - `less /tmp/rustup` (inspect downloaded script before running it)
    - `sh /tmp/rustup` (follow on-screen instructions -- option 1 is fine to
      start with)
    - add `source $HOME/.cargo/env` to your shell init script (e.g. `.bashrc` or
      `.zshrc`)
  - Add the WebAssembly target to add support for producing WebAssembly binaries
    (see
    [Rust Platform Support](https://forge.rust-lang.org/release/platform-support.html)):
    `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`
  - Install additional tools (e.g. `rustfmt` and `clippy`) as indicated by the
    [`Dockerfile`](/Dockerfile) contents.
- **Support for [musl](https://musl.libc.org/)** (on Linux): The
  [Oak Runtime](/docs/concepts.md#oak-runtime) is built as a
  [fully static binary](https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/platform-and-target-support/musl-support-for-fully-static-binaries.html),
  on Linux, which requires:
  - the Rust `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` target
    (`rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`)
  - the [musl-tools](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=musl-tools)
    package to be installed.
- **Bazel**: The [Bazel build system](https://bazel.build) is used for building
  C++ code and managing its dependencies. These dependencies are listed in the
  top-level [`WORKSPACE`](/WORKSPACE) file; see the
  [Bazel docs](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/external.html) for more
  information. Follow the
  [Bazel install instructions](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install.html).
- **Protocol Buffers**: Install the appropriate version of the protobuf compiler
  from the
  [releases page](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases).

These prerequisites cover what's needed to build the core codebase, and to run
the top-level build scripts described in the sections below.

A full development environment for the project also includes various extra
tools, for example for linting and synchronizing documentation. As ever, the
[`Dockerfile`](/Dockerfile) holds the details, but the scripts under
[`scripts/`](/scripts) also indicate what's needed for different steps.

## Runner

`runner` is a utility binary to perform a number of common tasks within the Oak
repository. It can be run by invoking `./scripts/runner` from the root of the
repository, and it has a number of flags and sub-commands available, which
should be self-explanatory.

For convenience, the following commands install a `runner` alias and bash
autocompletion:

```bash
alias runner=./scripts/runner
source <(runner completion)
```

## Run Example Application

Running one of the example Oak applications will confirm that all core
prerequisites have been installed. Run one inside Docker with:

```bash
./scripts/docker_run ./scripts/runner run-examples --example-name=hello_world
```

or, if all prerequisites are available on the local system, outside of Docker:

```bash
./scripts/runner run-examples --example-name=hello_world
```

That script:

- builds the Oak Runtime (a combination of C++ and Rust, built to run on the
  host system)
- builds a particular example, including both:
  - the Oak Application itself (Rust code that is compiled to a WebAssembly
    binary)
  - an external client (C++ code built to run on the host system)
- starts the Runtime as a background process, passing it the compiled
  WebAssembly for the Oak Application (which it then runs in a WebAssembly
  engine)
- runs the external client for the Application
- closes everything down.

Those steps are broken down in the following subsections; this helps figure out
where the problem is if something goes wrong.

### Build Application

The following command compiles the code for an example Oak Application from Rust
to a WebAssembly module and then serializes it into a binary application
configuration file to be loaded to the Oak Server:

```bash
./scripts/runner run-examples --run-server=false --client-variant=none --example-name=hello_world
```

This binary application configuration file includes the compiled Wasm code for
the Oak Application, embedded in a serialized protocol buffer that also includes
the Application's configuration.

The `scripts/build_example` script also builds (using Bazel) the corresponding
client code for the Oak Application, to produce a binary that runs on the host
system. Because the client talks to the Oak Application over gRPC, the client
can be written in any language that supports gRPC; most of the example clients
are written in C++, but there are clients in
[Go](/examples/translator/client/go/translator.go) and
[Rust](/examples/authentication/client/src/main.rs).

### Build Runtime Server

The following command builds the Oak Runtime server. An initial build will take
some time, but subsequent builds should be cached and so run much faster.

```bash
./scripts/runner build-server
```

### Run Runtime Server

The following command builds and runs an Oak Server instance, running a specific
Oak Application (which must already have been compiled into WebAssembly and
built into a serialized configuration, as [described above](#build-application).

```bash
./scripts/runner run-examples --client-variant=none --example-name=hello_world
```

In the end, you should end up with an Oak server running, end with log output
something like:

```log
2020-05-11 10:14:14,952 INFO  [sdk/rust/oak/src/lib.rs:460] starting event loop
2020-05-11 10:14:14,952 DEBUG [oak_runtime::runtime] NodeId(2): wait_on_channels: channels not ready, parking thread Thread { id: ThreadId(4), name: Some("log.LogNode(2)") }
2020-05-11 10:14:14,955 DEBUG [oak_runtime::node::wasm] hello_world.WasmNode-oak_main(1): wait_on_channels(1114152, 1)
2020-05-11 10:14:14,955 DEBUG [oak_runtime::runtime] NodeId(1): wait_on_channels: channels not ready, parking thread Thread { id: ThreadId(3), name: Some("hello_world.WasmNode-oak_main(1)") }
```

### Run Example Client

The following command (run in a separate terminal) compiles the code for the
client of an example Oak Application (as [described above](#build-application)),
and runs the client code locally.

```bash
./scripts/runner --logs run-examples --run-server=false --example-name=hello_world
```

The `-s none` option indicates that the script expects to find an
already-running Oak Runtime (from the previous section), rather than launching
an Oak Runtime instance of its own.

The client should run to completion and give output something like:

```log
I0511 10:15:29.539814 244858 hello_world.cc:66] Connecting to Oak Application: localhost:8080

```

### Signing Oak Wasm modules

As described in [Oak Concepts](/docs/concepts.md#labels) Oak Wasm modules can be
signed using [Ed25519](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/) scheme.

If you are reviewing an Oak module (for example `private_set_intersection.wasm`)
and want to create a signature for it, first you need a private/public key pair.
It can be generated with `oak_sign` utility using the following script (that
will generate two key files: `test.key` and `test.pub`)

```bash
./scripts/oak_sign generate \
  --private-key=examples/keys/ed25519/test.key \
  --public-key=examples/keys/ed25519/test.pub
```

Then a Wasm module can be signed using the following command:

```bash
./scripts/oak_sign sign \
  --private-key=examples/keys/ed25519/test.key \
  --input-file=examples/private_set_intersection/bin/private_set_intersection.wasm \
  --signature-file=examples/private_set_intersection/bin/signature.sign
```

This command generates a signature file `signature.sign` containing a public
key, a signature of the Wasm module SHA-256 hash (also encoded with PEM) and a
Wasm module SHA-256 hash itself.

Wasm module signatures are specified as part of the Oak application manifest.
The application manifest can contain locations of signature manifest files. Each
signature manifest file contains the locations of signature files for signed Oak
Wasm modules. Also, since each module can be signed by multiple entities, each
module may have multiple signatures.

Assuming the application manifest file contains the following configuration:

```toml
signature_manifests = [
  { path = "examples/private_set_intersection/signatures.toml" },
]

```

The `signatures.toml` file can look like this:

```toml
signatures = [
  { path = "examples/private_set_intersection/signature.sign" },
  { path = "examples/private_set_intersection/additional_signature.sign" },
]

```

Where `signature.sign` and `additional_signature.sign` are signatures that could
be provided by different reviewers.

Oak clients can download the `test.pub` public key (from the reviewer's public
repository) and use it as a
[label](/docs/programming-oak.md#using-an-oak-application-from-a-client) for
requests sent to the corresponding Oak application.

## Fuzz testing

We currently have fuzz testing enabled for Oak Functions on
[OSS-Fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects/oak). In
addition, the runner has a command for running fuzz targets `run-fuzz-targets`.
This command runs `cargo-fuzz` with the `-O` option for optimization, and
supports all `libFuzzer` options. These options must be provided as the last
argument. For instance, the following command runs all fuzz targets with a 2
seconds timeout for each target.

```bash
./scripts/runner run-fuzz-targets -- -max_total_time=2
```

The following lists all the `libFuzzer` options:

```bash
./scripts/runner --logs run-fuzz-targets -- -help=1
```

Moreover, `crate-name` alone or together with `target-name` could be specified
to run all targets for a specific crate, or to run a specific target,
respectively.

```bash
./scripts/runner --logs run-fuzz-targets --crate-name=loader --target-name=wasm_invoke -- -max_total_time=20
```
