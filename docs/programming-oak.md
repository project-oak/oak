## Writing an Oak Node

Oak Applications are built from a collection of inter-connected Oak **Nodes**,
so the first step is to understand how to build a single Oak Node.

Writing software for the Oak system involves a certain amount of boilerplate, so
this section will cover the hows &ndash; and whys &ndash; of this, using code
taken from the various [examples](../examples/). If you're impatient, you could
start by copying the `hello_world` example in particular, and just try modifying
things from there.

### Per-Node Boilerplate

An Oak Node needs to provide a single
[main entrypoint](abi.md#exported-function), which is the point at which Node
execution begins. However, Node authors don't _have_ to implement this function
themselves; for a Node which receives messages (a combination of bytes and
handles) that can be
[decoded](https://project-oak.github.io/oak/sdk/doc/oak/io/trait.Decodable.html)
into a Rust type, there are helper functions in the Oak SDK that make this
easier.

To use these helpers, an Oak Node should be a `struct` of some kind to represent
the internal state of the Node itself (which may be empty), implement the
[`oak::Node`](https://project-oak.github.io/oak/sdk/doc/oak/trait.Node.html)
trait for it, then define an
[`entrypoint`](https://project-oak.github.io/oak/sdk/doc/oak/macro.entrypoint.html)
so the Oak SDK knows how to instantiate it.

The defined entrypoint should run an `oak::run_event_loop` function that is
specified with a channel handle (used for reading messages) and an Oak Node that
receives these messages. For example, such a handle could be provided by the
gRPC server pseudo-Node:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
[embedmd]:# (../examples/machine_learning/module/rust/src/lib.rs Rust /^oak::entrypoint!\(grpc_oak_main.*/ /}\);$/)
```Rust
oak::entrypoint!(grpc_oak_main<ConfigMap> => |_receiver| {
    oak::logger::init_default();
    let node = Node {
        training_set_size: 1000,
        test_set_size: 1000,
        config: None,
        model: NaiveBayes::new(),
    };
    let grpc_channel =
        oak::grpc::server::init("[::]:8080").expect("could not create gRPC server pseudo-Node");
    oak::run_command_loop(node, grpc_channel.iter());
});
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

If the Node needs per-instance state, this Node `struct` is an ideal place to
store it. For example, the running average example has a `Node` `struct` with a
running sum and count of samples:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
[embedmd]:# (../examples/running_average/module/rust/src/lib.rs Rust /.*struct Handler {.*/ /^}/)
```Rust
struct Handler {
    sum: u64,
    count: u64,
}
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Under the covers the
[`entrypoint!`](https://project-oak.github.io/oak/sdk/doc/oak/macro.entrypoint.html)
macro converts the provided function body into an
[external function](abi.md#exported-function) suitable for WebAssembly use,
[taking care](#panic-handling) of
[handling `panic`s](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/ffi.html#ffi-and-panics).

For Nodes that act as gRPC servers (the normal "front door" for an Oak
Application), the easiest way to use a gRPC service implementation is to:

- call the
  [`oak::grpc::server::init()`](https://project-oak.github.io/oak/sdk/doc/oak/grpc/server/fn.init.html)
  helper from the Oak SDK to set up a
  [gRPC server pseudo-Node](concepts.md#pseudo-nodes) and acquire a channel to
  receive gRPC invocations on
- wrap the Node `struct` in the automatically generated `Dispatcher`, as
  described in the [next section](#generated-grpc-service-code)
- pass the `Dispatcher` and the channel handle to the
  [`run_event_loop()`](https://project-oak.github.io/oak/sdk/doc/oak/fn.run_event_loop.html)
  function.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
[embedmd]:# (../examples/translator/module/rust/src/lib.rs Rust /oak::entrypoint!\(grpc_oak_main/ /^}/)
```Rust
oak::entrypoint!(grpc_oak_main<ConfigMap> => |_receiver| {
    oak::logger::init_default();
    let grpc_channel =
        oak::grpc::server::init("[::]:8080").expect("could not create gRPC server pseudo-Node");
    oak::run_command_loop(Node, grpc_channel.iter());
}
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Alternatively a Node can implement the
[`oak::grpc::ServerNode`](https://project-oak.github.io/oak/sdk/doc/oak/grpc/trait.ServerNode.html)
trait (which provides an automatic implementation of the
[`Node`](https://project-oak.github.io/oak/sdk/doc/oak/trait.Node.html))
manually. The
[machine learning example](https://github.com/project-oak/oak/blob/main/examples/machine_learning/module/rust/src/lib.rs)
demonstrates this.

#### Panic Handling

Any Rust panic originating in an Oak Node must be caught before going through
the Wasm FFI boundary. If you use the `entrypoint!` macro, this is done for you,
but a manually implemented Node should use the
[`catch_unwind`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/panic/fn.catch_unwind.html)
method from the Rust standard library:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
[embedmd]:# (../examples/abitest/module_0/rust/src/lib.rs Rust /^#.*no_mangle.*/ /^}/)
```Rust
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn frontend_oak_main(_in_handle: u64) {
    let _ = std::panic::catch_unwind(|| {
        oak::set_panic_hook();
        let node = FrontendNode::new();
        let grpc_channel =
            oak::grpc::server::init("[::]:8080").expect("could not create gRPC server pseudo-Node");
        oak::run_command_loop(node, grpc_channel.iter());
    });
}
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### Generated gRPC service code

The Oak SDK provides
[`oak_utils::compile_protos`](https://project-oak.github.io/oak/oak_utils/doc/oak_utils/fn.compile_protos.html)
to autogenerate Rust code from a
[gRPC service definition](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/concepts/). Adding a
`build.rs` file to the Node that uses this function results in a generated file
`<service>_grpc.rs` appearing under the crate's build
[`OUT_DIR`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html)
(by default).

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
[embedmd]:# (../examples/translator/common/build.rs Rust /fn main/ /^}/)
```Rust
fn main() {
    // Generate the Oak-specific server and client code for the gRPC service,
    // along with the Rust types corresponding to the message definitions.
    oak_utils::compile_protos(
        &["../proto/translator.proto"],
        &["../proto", "../third_party"],
    );
}
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

The autogenerated code includes three parts, described in more detail below:

- A server-side trait definition.
- A `Dispatcher` `struct` that handles routing of server-side gRPC method
  invocations.
- A client-side `struct` to allow easy use of the gRPC service from an Oak Node.

The first part is a trait definition that includes a method for each of the
methods in the gRPC service, taking the relevant (auto-generated) request and
response types. The Oak Node implements the gRPC service by implementing this
trait.

```Rust
pub trait Translator {
    fn translate(&mut self, req: TranslateRequest) -> ::oak::grpc::Result<TranslateResponse>;
}
```

The second part of the autogenerated code includes a `Dispatcher` struct which
maps a request (as a method name and encoded request) to an invocation of the
relevant method on the service trait. This `Dispatcher` struct can then form the
entire implementation of the `ServerNode::invoke()` method described in the
previous section.

Taken altogether, these two parts cover all of the boilerplate needed to have a
Node act as a gRPC server:

- The main `oak_main` entrypoint invokes `oak::grpc::event_loop` with a
  `Dispatcher` and a handle for a channel from a gRPC server pseudo-Node.
- This `Dispatcher` is created by wrapping a Node `struct` that implements the
  gRPC generated service trait.
- The `Dispatcher` implements `oak::grpc::ServerNode` so the `event_loop()`
  method can call into the relevant per-service method of the Node.

Finally, the third part of the autogenerated code includes a stub implementation
of the client side for the gRPC service. If a Node offers a gRPC service to
other Nodes in the same Application, they can use this client stub code to get
simple access to the service.

## Running an Oak Application

In order to run the Oak Application, each of the WebAssembly Nodes that comprise
the Application must first be compiled into one or more WebAssembly modules, and
these compiled WebAssembly modules are then assembled into an overall
Application Configuration File.

Each of these steps is described in the following sections.

### Compiling to WASM Module

In order to build a WebAssembly module for an Oak WebAssembly Node, written in
Rust, `cargo build` should be used with `--target=wasm32-unknown-unknown`, as
follows:

```bash
cargo -Zunstable-options build --release \
  --target=wasm32-unknown-unknown \
  --manifest-path=examples/hello_world/module/rust/Cargo.toml \
  --out-dir=examples/hello_world/bin
```

The `--out-dir` option ensures that the resulting binary is copied into a
specific directory to allow later steps to find it. Since `--out-dir` is
unstable, `-Zunstable-options` is required as well.

### Creating a Configuration File

In order to load an Oak Application into the Oak Server its configuration must
be serialized into a binary file that will be parsed by the
[_Application Configuration Serializer_](../sdk/rust/oak_config_serializer), as
follows:

```bash
cargo run --manifest-path=sdk/rust/oak_app_build/Cargo.toml -- \
  --manifest-path=examples/hello_world/oak_app_manifest.toml
```

The input file is the .toml manifest file and the output is the binary
containing all the needed modules, which will be generated under the `bin`
directory alongside the manifest file. Here is an example of a manifest file:

```toml
name = "hello_world"

[modules]
app = { path = "examples/hello_world/bin/hello_world.wasm" }
translator = { path = "examples/hello_world/bin/translator.wasm" }

```

All these steps are implemented as a part of the
`./scripts/runner run-examples --example-name=hello_world` script.

Oak Config Serializer also allows to download Wasm modules from
[Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage). In order to do this,
the application configuration file should include `external` as a module
location:

```toml
name = "hello_world"

[modules]
app = { external = { url = "https://storage.googleapis.com/oak-modules/hello_world/57ba0bcebf2c01389d0413736b0a3bb261312bcf0d6e87181359e402df751d50", sha256 = "57ba0bcebf2c01389d0413736b0a3bb261312bcf0d6e87181359e402df751d50" } }
translator = { path = "examples/hello_world/bin/translator.wasm" }

```

It is also possible to save compiled Wasm modules to Google Cloud Storage using
the following script:

```bash
./scripts/push_example -e hello_world
```

### Starting the Oak Application

The Oak Application is then started using the Oak Loader:

```bash
./oak_loader/target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/oak_loader --application=./examples/hello_world/bin/hello_world.oak
```

The Oak Loader will launch an [Oak Runtime](concepts.md#oak-runtime), and this
Runtime will check the provided Wasm module(s) and application configuration.
Assuming everything is correct (e.g. the Nodes all have a main entrypoint and
only expect to link to the Oak [host functions](abi.md#host-functions)), the Oak
Runtime opens up the gRPC port specified by the Application Configuration. This
port is then used by clients to connect to the Oak Application.

### Configuring the Oak Application

The Application configuration [described above](#creating-a-configuration-file)
gives the configuration of the Application as seen by the Runtime: what Wasm
modules to load, what entrypoint to invoke. However, the Application may need
some start-of-day configuration of its own, roughly equivalent to runtime
options for a normal executable.

Oak supports this using a [`ConfigMap`](/oak_abi/proto/application.proto)
message, holding arbitrary key:value data for initial configuration. At
Application start-up, the Oak Runtime sends the serialized form of this message
as a single message on the initial Node's initial channel (and then closes the
channel).

The initial Node of an Application can retrieve this configuration by reading
from the implicit incoming channel, usually via a `Receiver<ConfigMap>`
instance.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
[embedmd]:# (../examples/trusted_database/module/rust/src/lib.rs Rust /oak::entrypoint/ /.*let config_map =.*/)
```Rust
oak::entrypoint!(oak_main<ConfigMap> => |receiver: Receiver<ConfigMap>| {
    oak::logger::init_default();
    let config_map = receiver.receive().expect("Couldn't read config map");
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

## Using an Oak Application from a client

A client that is outside of the Oak ecosystem can use an Oak Application by
interacting with it as a gRPC service, using the endpoint (host:port) from the
previous section (which would typically be published by the ISV providing the
Oak Application).

The client connects to the gRPC service, and sends (Application-specific) gRPC
requests to it, over a channel that has end-to-end encryption into the Runtime
instance, and also specifies a [Label](/docs/concepts.md#labels) to attach to
the request, which is used to enforce Information Flow Control within the
running Oak Application:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
[embedmd]:# (../examples/hello_world/client/cpp/hello_world.cc C++ /.*Connect to the/ /GetTlsChannelCredentials.*/)
```C++
  // Connect to the Oak Application.
  auto stub = HelloWorld::NewStub(oak::ApplicationClient::CreateChannel(
      address, oak::ApplicationClient::GetTlsChannelCredentials(ca_cert), label));
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Because the Oak Application is available as a gRPC service, clients written in
any language that supports gRPC can use the service. For example in Rust:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
[embedmd]:# (../examples/private_set_intersection/client/rust/src/main.rs Rust /^.*create_client.*/ /^}/)
```Rust
async fn create_client(
    uri: &Uri,
    root_tls_certificate: &[u8],
    public_key: &[u8],
) -> anyhow::Result<PrivateSetIntersectionClient<Channel>> {
    info!("Connecting to Oak Application: {:?}", uri);
    let channel = create_tls_channel(uri, root_tls_certificate)
        .await
        .context("Couldn't create TLS channel")?;
    let label = confidentiality_label(web_assembly_module_signature_tag(public_key));
    let interceptor = Interceptor::create(&label).context("Couldn't create gRPC interceptor")?;
    Ok(PrivateSetIntersectionClient::with_interceptor(
        channel,
        interceptor,
    ))
}
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Or for example in Go:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
[embedmd]:# (../examples/translator/client/go/translator.go Go /.*Connect to the Oak/ /NewTranslatorClient.*/)
```Go
	// Connect to the Oak Application.
	creds, err := credentials.NewClientTLSFromFile(*caCert, "")
	if err != nil {
		glog.Exitf("Failed to set up TLS client credentials from %q: %v", *caCert, err)
	}
	// TODO(#1066): Use a more restrictive Label.
	label := label_pb.Label{}
	metadata, err := NewLabelMetadata(label)
	if err != nil {
		glog.Exitf("Failed to create label metadata for %v: %v", label, err)
	}
	conn, err := grpc.Dial(*address, grpc.WithTransportCredentials(creds), grpc.WithPerRPCCredentials(metadata))
	if err != nil {
		glog.Exitf("Failed to dial Oak Application at %v: %v", *address, err)
	}
	defer conn.Close()
	client := translator_pb.NewTranslatorClient(conn)
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

## gRPC Request Processing Path

At this point, the client code can interact with the Node code via gRPC. A
typical sequence for this (using the various helpers described in previous
sections) would be as follows:

- The Node code (Wasm code running in a Wasm interpreter, running in the Oak
  Runtime) is blocked inside a call to the `oak.wait_on_channels()` host
  function from the `oak::grpc::event_loop` helper function.
  - `event_loop()` was invoked directly from the `oak_main()` exported function.
- The client C++ code builds a gRPC request and sends it to the Oak Runtime.
  - This connection is end-to-end encrypted using TLS.
- The gRPC server pseudo-Node (which is part of the Oak Runtime) receives the
  message and encapsulates it in a `GrpcRequest` wrapper message.
- The gRPC server pseudo-Node serializes the `GrpcRequest` and writes it to the
  gRPC-in channel for the Node. It also creates a new channel for any responses,
  and passes a handle for this response channel alongside the request.
- This unblocks the Node code, and `oak::grpc::event_loop` reads and
  deserializes the incoming gRPC request. It then calls the `Dispatcher`'s
  `invoke()` method with the method name and (serialized) gRPC request.
- The auto-generated `Dispatcher` invokes the relevant method on the `Node`.
- The (user-written) code in this method does its work, and returns a response.
- The auto-generated `Dispatcher` struct encapsulates the response into a
  `GrpcResponse` wrapper message, and serializes into the response channel.
- The gRPC server pseudo-Node reads this message from the response channel,
  deserializes it and sends the inner response back to the client.
- The client C++ code receives the response.

## Nodes, Channels and Handles

So far, we've only discussed writing a single Node for an Oak Application. This
Node communicates with the outside world via a single channel. The other half of
this single channel is a gRPC pseudo-Node, which passes on requests from
external clients (and which is automatically created by the Oak Runtime at
Application start-of-day).

More sophisticated Applications are normally built from multiple interacting
Nodes, for several reasons:

- Dividing software into well-defined interacting components is a normal way to
  reduce the overall complexity of software design.
- Software that handles sensitive data, or which has additional privileges,
  often separates out the parts that deal with this (the
  ["principle of least privilege"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege)),
  to reduce the blast radius if something goes wrong.
- Information flow analysis can be more precise and fine-grained if components
  are smaller and the interactions between them are constrained.

The first step in building a multi-Node Application is to write the code for all
of the Nodes; the `ApplicationConfiguration` needs to include the configuration
and code for any Node that might get run as part of the Application. New Node
types cannot be added after the application starts; any Node that the
Application might need has to be included in the original configuration.

As before, each Node must include a main entrypoint with signature
`fn(u64) -> ()`, but for an internal Node it's entirely up to the ISV as to what
channel handle gets passed to this entrypoint, and as to what messages are sent
down that channel. The application may choose to use protobuf-encoded messages
(as gRPC does) for its internal communications, or something else entirely (e.g.
the [serde crate](https://crates.io/crates/serde)).

Regardless of how the Application communicates with the new Node, the typical
pattern for the existing Node is to:

- Create a new channel with the
  [`channel_create`](https://project-oak.github.io/oak/sdk/doc/oak/fn.channel_create.html)
  host function, receiving local handles for both halves of the channel.
- Create a new Node instance with the
  [`node_create`](https://project-oak.github.io/oak/sdk/doc/oak/fn.node_create.html)
  host function, passing in the handle for the read half of the new channel.
- Afterwards, close the local handle for the read half, as it is no longer
  needed, and use the local handle for the write half to send messages to the
  new Node instance.

For example, the [example Chat application](../examples/chat) creates a Node for
each chat room and saves off the write handle that will be used to send messages
to the room:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
[embedmd]:# (../examples/chat/module/rust/src/lib.rs Rust /.*self\.rooms\.entry\(/ /\}\);$/)
```Rust
                let channel = self.rooms.entry(label.clone()).or_insert_with(|| {
                    oak::io::entrypoint_node_create::<Room>("room", &label, "app")
                        .expect("could not create node")
                });
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end-->

The same code (identified by `"room-config"`) will be run for each per-room
Node, but each instance will have its own Web Assembly linear memory (≈heap) and
stack.

The `node_create()` call triggers the Oak Runtime to invoke the main entrypoint
for the new Node (as specified in the Application configuration), passing in the
handle value for the channel read half that was provided as a parameter to
`node_create()`. Note that the actual handle _value_ passed into the main
entrypoint will (almost certainly) be different; internally, the Runtime
translates the creator Node's handle value to a reference to the underlying
channel object, then assigns a new numeric value for the created Node to use to
refer to the underlying channel.

Once a new Node has started, the existing Node can communicate with the new Node
by sending messages over the channel via `channel_write`. Of course, the new
Node only has a handle to the read half of a channel, and so only has a way of
_receiving_.

To cope with this, it's normal for the inbound messages to be accompanied by a
handle for the _write_ half of a different channel, which is then used for
responses &ndash; so the new Node has a way of _sending_ externally, as well as
receiving.

For nodes that communicate by exchanging messages that are serialized protocol
buffer messages, the Oak SDK allows encoding channel handles into protobuf
messages:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
[embedmd]:# (../examples/injection/proto/injection.proto Protobuf /^message BlobStoreSender/ /^}$/)
```Protobuf
message BlobStoreSender {
  oak.handle.Sender sender = 1 [(oak.handle.message_type) = ".oak.examples.injection.BlobResponse"];
}
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

The `message_type` field option provided by the SDK specifies the fully
qualified (with leading dot) name of the protobuf message passed over the
channel.

The above protobuf definition generates the following Rust data type:

```Rust
struct BlobStoreSender {
  sender: ::oak_io::Sender<BlobResponse>,
}
```

An `oak.handle.Receiver` type is also available for read handles.

The generated struct is fully type safe, encoding the direction of the handle
(`Sender` or `Receiver`) as well as the type of the message that is sent or
received using `message_type`.

## Testing

> "Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried
> it." - [Donald Knuth](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/faq.html)

Regardless of how the code for an Oak Application is produced, it's always a
good idea to write tests. The
[`oak_tests`](https://project-oak.github.io/oak/sdk/doc/oak_tests/index.html)
crate allows Node gRPC service methods to be tested with the [Oak SDK](sdk.md)
framework via the Oak Runtime:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
[embedmd]:# (../examples/hello_world/module/rust/tests/integration_test.rs Rust /^.*Test invoking the SayHello Node service method via the Oak runtime.*/ /^}$/)
```Rust
// Test invoking the SayHello Node service method via the Oak runtime.
#[tokio::test(core_threads = 2)]
async fn test_say_hello() {
    let _ = env_logger::builder().is_test(true).try_init();

    let runtime = oak_tests::run_single_module_default(MODULE_WASM_FILE_NAME)
        .expect("Unable to configure runtime with test wasm!");

    let (channel, interceptor) = oak_tests::public_channel_and_interceptor().await;
    let mut client = HelloWorldClient::with_interceptor(channel, interceptor);

    let req = HelloRequest {
        greeting: "world".into(),
    };
    info!("Sending request: {:?}", req);

    let result = client.say_hello(req).await;
    assert_matches!(result, Ok(_));
    assert_eq!("HELLO world!", result.unwrap().into_inner().reply);

    runtime.stop();
}
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

This has a little bit of boilerplate to explain:

- The `oak_tests` crate provides a `run_single_module_default` method that is
  designed for use with single-Node Applications. It assumes that the Node has a
  main entrypoint called `oak_main`, which it runs in a separate thread.
- The injection of the gRPC request has to specify the method name (in the call
  to `oak_tests::grpc_request()`).
- The per-Node thread needs to be stopped at the end of the test
  (`oak_runtime::stop`).

### Testing Multi-Node Applications

It's also possible to test an Oak Application that's built from multiple Nodes,
by defining an appropriate `ApplicationConfiguration` instance and then
`oak_runtime::Runtime::configure_and_run(application_configuration, ...)` to
configure and run the Runtime.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
[embedmd]:# (../examples/abitest/module_0/rust/tests/integration_test.rs Rust / +let wasm_modules =/ /unable to configure runtime.*/)
```Rust
    let wasm_modules = build_wasm().expect("failed to build wasm modules");
    let config = oak_tests::runtime_config_wasm(
        wasm_modules,
        FRONTEND_MODULE_NAME,
        FRONTEND_ENTRYPOINT_NAME,
        ConfigMap::default(),
    );
    let runtime =
        oak_runtime::configure_and_run(config).expect("unable to configure runtime with test wasm");
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
