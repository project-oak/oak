# Oak binaries with secure logging

Claim UUID: 75606\
Link to self:

An endorsement that doesn't have this claim means the underlying binary doesn't
log securely. This is intended to discriminate between e.g.
`oak_functions_container` (would have the claim) or
`oak_functions_insecure_container` (would not have the claim).
