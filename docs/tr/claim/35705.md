For any given execution, the binary generates a secret random number, calculates
its SHA2-256 digest, and then creates a cryptographic attestation that includes
the digest. The original secret number is then discarded and is never revealed
outside of the TEE.

See https://github.com/project-oak/oak/blob/main/ctf_sha2/README.md for more
details.
