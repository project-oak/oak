## MacOS

### From Docker.com

Follow [these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/).

Note that you may have to re-run Docker after each reboot or if you see an error like

```bash
docker: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?.
```
