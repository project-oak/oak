# This workflow wraps the SLSA generator reusable workflow and adds an
# additional step to simulate a dry run. This allows testing downstream jobs in
# the caller workflow. A reusable workflow is required, as opposed to a job
# with multiple steps, because `generator_generic_slsa3` iteslf is a reusable
# workflow and can only be referenced at the top-level `jobs.*.uses' key. In
# particular it cannot be used within a step guarded by the if.
