# This workflow simulates the steps necessary in order to release a new version of
# `oak_functions_loader`, but without actually releasing anything externally.
#
# For an actual release, the same steps would be followed, the resulting hash compared to that
# emitted by the last step here, and then the resulting binary and / or Docker image pushed
# externally.
