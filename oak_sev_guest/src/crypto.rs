/// Wrapper for encrypting and decrypting guest messages.
///
/// The sequence number is used as an initialization vector/nonce for AES-GCM.
/// The sequence number is internally incremented on every encryption to avoid
/// reuse. It is also incremented on every decryption to synchronize it with the
/// sequence number used by the Platform Secure Processor (PSP).
///
/// To make sure that the same sequence number is never reused with the same
/// key, the same key must never be used to instantiate more than one instance
/// of this struct.
///
/// If a request fails the PSP will not increment the sequence number. This
/// means that we will be out of sync with its sequence number. There is no safe
/// way to recover from that, so the best course of action is to delete the key
/// or shut down the VM.
