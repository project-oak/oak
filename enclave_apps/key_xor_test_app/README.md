# Sealing Key XOR Test Application

Application to test consistency of the derived sealing key generated by the
Restricted Kernel.

The application requests a derived key from the Restricted Kernel. It then keeps
reading bytes from the communication channel and XORs them with bytes from the
key, wrapping around to the start when the end of the key is reached.

The idea is to start an instance of the application and send a message, restart
the application, and send the XORed message. The resulting twice-XORed message
should match the original message if the sealing key remains consistent between
restarts of the application.

Note: This application leaks the derived key, so this should never be used for
anything else than testing. Since the key is application-specific, leaking the
key for this application does not affect the security for any other
applications.
