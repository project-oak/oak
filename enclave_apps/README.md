# Enclave Applications

This directory contains applications that can be run using the Oak Restricted
Kernel. The applications are intended to be run in a VM-based Trusted Execution
Environment (such as AMD SEV-SNP).

These applications all share the same Cargo configuration which is needed to
make them compatible with the Oak Restricted Kernel.
