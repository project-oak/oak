# Oak Restricted Kernel Wrapper

A minimal wrapper for the Oak Restricted kernel that is compatible with the
[Linux x86-64 boot protocol v2.15](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v6.5/arch/x86/boot.html).
This wrapper allows the Stage 0 virtual firmware to boot the Oak Restricted
Kernel in the same way as a compressed 64-bit Linux kernel.

The wrapper is responsible for parsing the payload (the Oak Restricted Kernel)
as an ELF file, laying it out in memory and doing any required relocations.

NOTE: This wrapper is not intended to be built using `cargo build` directly.

To build it, run the following in the workspace root:

```bash
just oak_restricted_kernel_wrapper
```
