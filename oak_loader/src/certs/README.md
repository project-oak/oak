# Trusted CA Root Certificates

The CA root certificates that are trusted by the gRPC client node for TLS
connections are specified in `roots.pem`. The file is embedded into the compiled
Oak Loader binary as a byte array. The trusted root certificates can only be
overridden if the `oak_unsafe` feature is enabled.

It is built from the list of trusted CA root certificates used by Android. The
file can be regenerated by running:

```bash
./scripts/generate_root_ca_certs
```

The script downloads a specified version of the certificates from the Android
source tree. The current version is based on the files used in Android 10:
