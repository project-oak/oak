# Trusted CA Root Certificates

The CA root certificates that are trusted by the gRPC client node for TLS
connections are specified in `roots.pem`. The file is embedded into the compiled
Oak Loader binary as a byte array. The trusted root certificates can only be
overridden if the `oak_debug` feature is enabled.

It is built from the list of trusted CA root certificates used by Android. The
file can be regenerated by running:

```bash
./scripts/generate_root_ca_certs
```

The script uses a git submodule pinned to a specified version of the
certificates from the Android source tree. The current version is based on the
files used in Android 10:
