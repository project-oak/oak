/* Form 1 instructions come in different flavors:

    Some have no arguments                          (MOXIE_F1_NARG)
    Some only use the A operand                     (MOXIE_F1_A)
    Some use A and B registers                      (MOXIE_F1_AB)
    Some use A and consume a 4 byte immediate value (MOXIE_F1_A4)
    Some use just a 4 byte immediate value          (MOXIE_F1_4)
    Some use just a 4 byte memory address           (MOXIE_F1_M)
    Some use B and an indirect A                    (MOXIE_F1_AiB)
    Some use A and an indirect B                    (MOXIE_F1_ABi)
    Some consume a 4 byte immediate value and use X (MOXIE_F1_4A)
    Some use B and an indirect A plus 4 bytes       (MOXIE_F1_AiB4)
    Some use A and an indirect B plus 4 bytes       (MOXIE_F1_ABi4)

  Form 2 instructions also come in different flavors:

    Some have no arguments                          (MOXIE_F2_NARG)
    Some use the A register and an 8-bit value      (MOXIE_F2_A8V)

  Form 3 instructions also come in different flavors:

    Some have no arguments                          (MOXIE_F3_NARG)
    Some have a 10-bit PC relative operand          (MOXIE_F3_PCREL).  */
