/*
 * We only use the coff headers to tell the kernel
 * how to exec the file.  Therefore, the only fields that need to 
 * be filled in are the scnptr and vaddr for the text and data
 * sections, and the vaddr for the bss.  As far as coff is concerned,
 * there is no symbol table, relocation, or line numbers.
 *
 * A normal bsd header (struct exec) is placed after the coff headers,
 * and before the real text.  I defined a the new fields 'a_machtype'
 * and a_flags.  If a_machtype is M_386, and a_flags & A_ENCAP is
 * true, then the bsd header is preceeded by a coff header.  Macros
 * like N_TXTOFF and N_TXTADDR use this field to find the bsd header.
 * 
 * The only problem is to track down the bsd exec header.  The
 * macros HEADER_OFFSET, etc do this.

/* Encapsulated coff files that are linked ZMAGIC have a text segment

   layout and the virtual memory layout page-aligned.

   Non-encapsulated a.out files that are linked ZMAGIC have a text
   segment that starts at 0 and an N_TXTADR similarly offset to 0.
   They too are page-aligned with each other, but they include the
   a.out header as part of the text. 

   The _N_HDROFF gets sizeof struct exec added to it, so we have
   to compensate here.  See <a.out.gnu.h>.  */
