/* Virtual memory address of the text section.
   This is getting very complicated.  A good reason to discard a.out format
   for something that specifies these fields explicitly.  But til then...

   * OMAGIC and NMAGIC files:
       (object files: text for "relocatable addr 0" right after the header)
       start at 0, offset is EXEC_BYTES_SIZE, size as stated.
   * The text address, offset, and size of ZMAGIC files depend
     on the entry point of the file:
     * entry point below TEXT_START_ADDR:
       (hack for SunOS shared libraries)
       start at 0, offset is 0, size as stated.
     * If N_HEADER_IN_TEXT(x) is true (which defaults to being the
       case when the entry point is EXEC_BYTES_SIZE or further into a page):
       no padding is needed; text can start after exec header.  Sun
       considers the text segment of such files to include the exec header;
       for BFD's purposes, we don't, which makes more work for us.
       start at TEXT_START_ADDR + EXEC_BYTES_SIZE, offset is EXEC_BYTES_SIZE,
       size as stated minus EXEC_BYTES_SIZE.
     * If N_HEADER_IN_TEXT(x) is false (which defaults to being the case when
       the entry point is less than EXEC_BYTES_SIZE into a page (e.g. page
       aligned)): (padding is needed so that text can start at a page boundary)
       start at TEXT_START_ADDR, offset TARGET_PAGE_SIZE, size as stated.

    Specific configurations may want to hardwire N_HEADER_IN_TEXT,
    for efficiency or to allow people to play games with the entry point.
    In that case, you would #define N_HEADER_IN_TEXT(x) as 1 for sunos,
    and as 0 for most other hosts (Sony News, Vax Ultrix, etc).
    (Do this in the appropriate bfd target file.)
    (The default is a heuristic that will break if people try changing
    the entry point, perhaps with the ld -e flag.)

    * QMAGIC is always like a ZMAGIC for which N_HEADER_IN_TEXT is true,
    and for which the starting address is TARGET_PAGE_SIZE (or should this be
    SEGMENT_SIZE?) (TEXT_START_ADDR only applies to ZMAGIC, not to QMAGIC).  */
