/* Page macros

   The first GDB port requires flags in its remote memory access commands to
   distinguish between data/prog space.  Hopefully we can make this go away
   eventually.  Stuff the page in the upper bits of a 32-bit address, since
   the c5x family only uses 16 or 23 bits.

   c2x, c5x and most c54x devices have 16-bit addresses, but the c548 has
   23-bit program addresses.  Make sure the page flags don't interfere.
   These flags are used by GDB to identify the destination page for
   addresses.
