/* General information:

   This header file defines and describes only the data structures
   necessary to read debug symbols produced by the HP C compiler,
   HP ANSI C++ compiler, and HP FORTRAN 90 compiler using the
   SOM object file format.  
   (For a full description of the debug format, ftp hpux-symtab.h from
   jaguar.cs.utah.edu:/dist).
   
   Additional notes (Rich Title)
   This file is a reverse-engineered version of a file called
   "symtab.h" which exists internal to HP's Computer Languages Organization
   in /CLO/Components/DDE/obj/som/symtab.h. Because HP's version of
   the file is copyrighted and not distributed, it is necessary for
   GDB to use the reverse-engineered version that follows.
   Work was done by Cygnus to reverse-engineer the C subset of symtab.h.
   The WDB project has extended this to also contain the C++ 
   symbol definitions, the F90 symbol definitions, 
   and the DOC (debugging-optimized-code) symbol definitions.
   In some cases (the C++ symbol definitions)
   I have added internal documentation here that
   goes beyond what is supplied in HP's symtab.h. If we someday
   unify these files again, the extra comments should be merged back
   into HP's symtab.h.
  
   -------------------------------------------------------------------

   Debug symbols are contained entirely within an unloadable space called
   $DEBUG$.  $DEBUG$ contains several subspaces which group related
   debug symbols.

   $GNTT$ contains information for global variables, types and contants.

   $LNTT$ contains information for procedures (including nesting), scoping
   information, local variables, types, and constants.

   $SLT$ contains source line information so that code addresses may be
   mapped to source lines.

   $VT$ contains various strings and constants for named objects (variables,
   typedefs, functions, etc).  Strings are stored as null-terminated character
   lists.  Constants always begin on word boundaries.  The first byte of
   the VT must be zero (a null string).

   $XT$ is not currently used by GDB.

   Many structures within the subspaces point to other structures within
   the same subspace, or to structures within a different subspace.  These
   pointers are represented as a structure index from the beginning of
   the appropriate subspace.  */

/* DNTT_TYPE_WITH is emitted by C++ to indicate "with" scoping semantics.

   C++ example: Say "memfunc" is a method of class "c", and say
   "m" is a data member of class "c". Then from within "memfunc",
   it is legal to reference "m" directly (e.g. you don't have to
   say "this->m". The symbol table indicates
   this by emitting a DNTT_TYPE_WITH symbol within the function "memfunc",
   pointing to the type symbol for class "c".
 
   In GDB, this symbol record is unnecessary, 
   because GDB's symbol lookup algorithm
   infers the "with" semantics when it sees a "this" argument to the member
   function. So GDB can safely ignore the DNTT_TYPE_WITH record.

    If it were a normal function (not a method), it would be visible

/*  PXDB definitions.
  
   PXDB is a post-processor which takes the executable file
   and massages the debug information so that the debugger may
   start up and run more efficiently.  Some of the tasks
   performed by PXDB are:
  
   o   Remove duplicate global type and variable information
       from the GNTT,
  
   o   Append the GNTT onto the end of the LNTT and place both
       back in the LNTT section,
  
   o   Build quick look-up tables (description follows) for
       files, procedures, modules, and paragraphs (for Cobol),
       placing these in the GNTT section,
  
   o   Reconstruct the header appearing in the header section
       to access this information.
  
   The "quick look-up" tables are in the $GNTT$ sub-space, in
   the following order:
  
       Procedures    -sorted by address
       Source files  -sorted by address (of the
                      generated code from routines)
       Modules       -sorted by address
       Classes       -<unsorted?>
       Address Alias -sorted by index <?>
       Object IDs    -sorted by object identifier
  
   Most quick entries have (0-based) indices into the LNTT tables to
   the full entries for the item it describes.
  
   The post-PXDB header is in the $HEADER$ sub-space.  Alas, it
   occurs in different forms, depending on the optimization level
   in the compilation step and whether PXDB was run or not. The
   worst part is the forms aren't self-describing, so we'll have
   to grovel in the bits to figure out what kind we're looking at
   (see hp_get_header in hp-psymtab-read.c).  */
