## Set merge driver for ChangeLog files 
# See gnulib's lib/git-merge-changelog.c (or git-merge-changelog(1))
# for per-user setup instructions.
#
# The short version of this (optional) procedure is:
# 
# (1) Install git-merge-changelog (this is the tricky part!)
#
# (2) Add something like the following to your ~/.gitconfig:
#
# [merge "merge-changelog"]
#         name = GNU-style ChangeLog merge driver
#         driver = git-merge-changelog %O %A %B
#
# (3) Enjoy mostly effortless ChangeLog merges, at least until the
#     file gets renamed again ...
