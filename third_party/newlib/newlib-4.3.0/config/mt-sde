# We default to building libraries optimised for size.  We use
# -minterlink-mips16 so that the non-MIPS16 libraries can still be
# linked against partly-MIPS16 code.  The -mcode-readable=pcrel option allows
# MIPS16 libraries to run on Harvard-style split I/D memories, so long
# as they have the D-to-I redirect for PC-relative loads.  -mno-gpopt
# has two purposes: it allows libraries to be used in situations where
# $gp != our _gp, and it allows them to be built with -G8 while
# retaining link compatibility with -G0 and -G4.
