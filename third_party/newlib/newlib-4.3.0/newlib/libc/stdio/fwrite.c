SYNOPSIS
	#include <stdio.h>
	size_t fwrite(const void *restrict <[buf]>, size_t <[size]>,
		      size_t <[count]>, FILE *restrict <[fp]>);

	#define _BSD_SOURCE
	#include <stdio.h>
	size_t fwrite_unlocked(const void *restrict <[buf]>, size_t <[size]>,
		      size_t <[count]>, FILE *restrict <[fp]>);

	#include <stdio.h>
	size_t _fwrite_r(struct _reent *<[ptr]>, const void *restrict <[buf]>, size_t <[size]>,
		      size_t <[count]>, FILE *restrict <[fp]>);

	#include <stdio.h>
	size_t _fwrite_unlocked_r(struct _reent *<[ptr]>, const void *restrict <[buf]>, size_t <[size]>,
		      size_t <[count]>, FILE *restrict <[fp]>);

DESCRIPTION
<<fwrite>> attempts to copy, starting from the memory location
<[buf]>, <[count]> elements (each of size <[size]>) into the file or
stream identified by <[fp]>.  <<fwrite>> may copy fewer elements than
<[count]> if an error intervenes.

<<fwrite>> also advances the file position indicator (if any) for
<[fp]> by the number of @emph{characters} actually written.

<<fwrite_unlocked>> is a non-thread-safe version of <<fwrite>>.
<<fwrite_unlocked>> may only safely be used within a scope
protected by flockfile() (or ftrylockfile()) and funlockfile().  This
function may safely be used in a multi-threaded program if and only
if they are called while the invoking thread owns the (FILE *)
object, as is the case after a successful call to the flockfile() or
ftrylockfile() functions.  If threads are disabled, then
<<fwrite_unlocked>> is equivalent to <<fwrite>>.

<<_fwrite_r>> and <<_fwrite_unlocked_r>> are simply reentrant versions of the
above that take an additional reentrant structure argument: <[ptr]>.

RETURNS
If <<fwrite>> succeeds in writing all the elements you specify, the
result is the same as the argument <[count]>.  In any event, the
result is the number of complete elements that <<fwrite>> copied to
the file.

PORTABILITY
ANSI C requires <<fwrite>>.

<<fwrite_unlocked>> is a BSD extension also provided by GNU libc.

Supporting OS subroutines required: <<close>>, <<fstat>>, <<isatty>>,
<<lseek>>, <<read>>, <<sbrk>>, <<write>>.
