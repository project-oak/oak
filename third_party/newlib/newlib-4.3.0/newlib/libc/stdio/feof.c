FUNCTION
<<feof>>, <<feof_unlocked>>---test for end of file

INDEX
	feof
INDEX
	feof_unlocked

SYNOPSIS
	#include <stdio.h>
	int feof(FILE *<[fp]>);

	#define _BSD_SOURCE
	#include <stdio.h>
	int feof_unlocked(FILE *<[fp]>);

DESCRIPTION
<<feof>> tests whether or not the end of the file identified by <[fp]>
has been reached.

<<feof_unlocked>> is a non-thread-safe version of <<feof>>.
<<feof_unlocked>> may only safely be used within a scope
protected by flockfile() (or ftrylockfile()) and funlockfile().  This
function may safely be used in a multi-threaded program if and only
if they are called while the invoking thread owns the (FILE *)
object, as is the case after a successful call to the flockfile() or
ftrylockfile() functions.  If threads are disabled, then
<<feof_unlocked>> is equivalent to <<feof>>.

RETURNS
<<feof>> returns <<0>> if the end of file has not yet been reached; if
at end of file, the result is nonzero.

PORTABILITY
<<feof>> is required by ANSI C.

<<feof_unlocked>> is a BSD extension also provided by GNU libc.

No supporting OS subroutines are required.
