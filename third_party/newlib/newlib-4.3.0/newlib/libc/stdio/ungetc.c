FUNCTION
<<ungetc>>---push data back into a stream

INDEX
	ungetc
INDEX
	_ungetc_r

SYNOPSIS
	#include <stdio.h>
	int ungetc(int <[c]>, FILE *<[stream]>);

	int _ungetc_r(struct _reent *<[reent]>, int <[c]>, FILE *<[stream]>);

DESCRIPTION
<<ungetc>> is used to return bytes back to <[stream]> to be read again.
If <[c]> is EOF, the stream is unchanged.  Otherwise, the unsigned
char <[c]> is put back on the stream, and subsequent reads will see
the bytes pushed back in reverse order.  Pushed byes are lost if the
stream is repositioned, such as by <<fseek>>, <<fsetpos>>, or
<<rewind>>.

The underlying file is not changed, but it is possible to push back
something different than what was originally read.  Ungetting a
character will clear the end-of-stream marker, and decrement the file
position indicator.  Pushing back beyond the beginning of a file gives
unspecified behavior.

The alternate function <<_ungetc_r>> is a reentrant version.  The
extra argument <[reent]> is a pointer to a reentrancy structure.

RETURNS
The character pushed back, or <<EOF>> on error.

PORTABILITY
ANSI C requires <<ungetc>>, but only requires a pushback buffer of one
byte; although this implementation can handle multiple bytes, not all
can.  Pushing back a signed char is a common application bug.

Supporting OS subroutines required: <<sbrk>>.
