@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

This reference manual describes the functions provided by the Red Hat
``newlib'' version of the standard ANSI C library.  This document is not
intended as an overview or a tutorial for the C library.  Each library
function is listed with a synopsis of its use, a brief description,
return values (including error handling), and portability issues.

Some of the library functions depend on support from the underlying
operating system and may not be available on every platform.  For
embedded systems in particular, many of these underlying operating
system services may not be available or may not be fully functional.
The specific operating system subroutines required for a particular
library function are listed in the ``Portability'' section of the
function description.  @xref{Syscalls}, for a description of the
relevant operating system calls.

@node Arglists
@chapter Variable Argument Lists

The @code{printf} family of functions is defined to accept a variable
number of arguments, rather than a fixed argument list.  You can define
your own functions with a variable argument list, by using macro
definitions from either @file{stdarg.h} (for compatibility with ANSI C)
or from @file{varargs.h} (for compatibility with a popular convention
prior to ANSI C).

@node Stdarg
@section ANSI-standard macros, @file{stdarg.h}

In ANSI C, a function has a variable number of arguments when its
parameter list ends in an ellipsis (@code{...}).  The parameter list
must also include at least one explicitly named argument; that argument
is used to initialize the variable list data structure.

ANSI C defines three macros (@code{va_start}, @code{va_arg}, and
@code{va_end}) to operate on variable argument lists.  @file{stdarg.h}
also defines a special type to represent variable argument lists: this
type is called @code{va_list}.  

@menu
* va_start::
* va_arg::
* va_end::
@end menu

@page
@node va_start
@subsection Initialize variable argument list
@findex va_start
@strong{Synopsis}
@example
#include <stdarg.h>
void va_start(va_list @var{ap}, @var{rightmost});
@end example

@strong{Description}@*
Use @code{va_start} to initialize the variable argument list @var{ap},
so that @code{va_arg} can extract values from it.  @var{rightmost} is
the name of the last explicit argument in the parameter list (the
argument immediately preceding the ellipsis @samp{...} that flags
variable arguments in an ANSI C function header).  You can only use
@code{va_start} in a function declared using this ellipsis notation
(not, for example, in one of its subfunctions).

@strong{Returns}@*
@code{va_start} does not return a result.

@strong{Portability}@*
ANSI C requires @code{va_start}.

@page
@node va_arg
@subsection Extract a value from argument list
@findex va_arg
@strong{Synopsis}
@example
#include <stdarg.h>
@var{type} va_arg(va_list @var{ap}, @var{type});
@end example

@strong{Description}@*
@code{va_arg} returns the next unprocessed value from a variable
argument list @var{ap} (which you must previously create with
@var{va_start}).  Specify the type for the value as the second parameter
to the macro, @var{type}.

You may pass a @code{va_list} object @var{ap} to a subfunction, and use
@code{va_arg} from the subfunction rather than from the function
actually declared with an ellipsis in the header; however, in that case
you may @emph{only} use @code{va_arg} from the subfunction.  ANSI C does
not permit extracting successive values from a single variable-argument
list from different levels of the calling stack.

There is no mechanism for testing whether there is actually a next
argument available; you might instead pass an argument count (or some
other data that implies an argument count) as one of the fixed arguments
in your function call.

@strong{Returns}@*
@code{va_arg} returns the next argument, an object of type @var{type}.

@strong{Portability}@*
ANSI C requires @code{va_arg}.

@page
@node va_end
@subsection Abandon a variable argument list
@findex va_end
@strong{Synopsis}
@example
#include <stdarg.h>
void va_end(va_list @var{ap});
@end example

@strong{Description}@*
Use @code{va_end} to declare that your program will not use the variable
argument list @var{ap} any further.

@strong{Returns}@*
@code{va_end} does not return a result.

@strong{Portability}@*
ANSI C requires @code{va_end}.

@node Varargs
@section Traditional macros, @file{varargs.h}

If your C compiler predates ANSI C, you may still be able to use
variable argument lists using the macros from the @file{varargs.h}
header file.  These macros resemble their ANSI counterparts, but have
important differences in usage.   In particular, since traditional C has
no declaration mechanism for variable argument lists, two additional
macros are provided simply for the purpose of defining functions with
variable argument lists.  

As with @file{stdarg.h}, the type @code{va_list} is used to hold a data
structure representing a variable argument list.

@menu
* va_alist::
* va_start-trad::
* va_arg-trad::
* va_end-trad::
@end menu

@page
@node va_alist
@subsection Declare variable arguments
@findex va_alist
@findex va_dcl
@strong{Synopsis}
@example
#include <varargs.h>
@var{function}(va_alist)
va_dcl
@end example

@strong{Description}@*
To use the @file{varargs.h} version of variable argument lists, you must
declare your function with a call to the macro @code{va_alist} as its
argument list, and use @code{va_dcl} as the declaration.  @emph{Do not
use a semicolon after @code{va_dcl}.}  

@strong{Returns}@*
These macros cannot be used in a context where a return is syntactically
possible. 

@strong{Portability}@*
@var{va_alist} and @var{va_dcl} were the most widespread method of
declaring variable argument lists prior to ANSI C.

@page
@node va_start-trad
@subsection Initialize variable argument list
@findex va_start
@strong{Synopsis}
@example
#include <varargs.h>
va_list @var{ap};
va_start(@var{ap});
@end example

@strong{Description}@*
With the @file{varargs.h} macros, use @code{va_start} to initialize a
data structure @var{ap} to permit manipulating a variable argument list.
@var{ap} must have the type @var{va_alist}.

@strong{Returns}@*
@code{va_start} does not return a result.

@strong{Portability}@*
@code{va_start} is also defined as a macro in ANSI C, but the
definitions are incompatible; the ANSI version has another parameter
besides @var{ap}.

@page
@node va_arg-trad
@subsection Extract a value from argument list
@findex va_arg
@strong{Synopsis}
@example
#include <varargs.h>
@var{type} va_arg(va_list @var{ap}, @var{type});
@end example

@strong{Description}@*
@code{va_arg} returns the next unprocessed value from a variable
argument list @var{ap} (which you must previously create with
@var{va_start}).  Specify the type for the value as the second parameter
to the macro, @var{type}.

@strong{Returns}@*
@code{va_arg} returns the next argument, an object of type @var{type}.

@strong{Portability}@*
The @code{va_arg} defined in @file{varargs.h} has the same syntax and
usage as the ANSI C version from @file{stdarg.h}.

@page
@node va_end-trad
@subsection Abandon a variable argument list
@findex va_end
@strong{Synopsis}
@example
#include <varargs.h>
va_end(va_list @var{ap});
@end example

@strong{Description}@*
Use @code{va_end} to declare that your program will not use the variable
argument list @var{ap} any further.

@strong{Returns}@*
@code{va_end} does not return a result.

@strong{Portability}@*
The @code{va_end} defined in @file{varargs.h} has the same syntax and
usage as the ANSI C version from @file{stdarg.h}.
