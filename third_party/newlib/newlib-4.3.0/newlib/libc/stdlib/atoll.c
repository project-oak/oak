/*
FUNCTION
<<atoll>>---convert a string to a long long integer

INDEX
        atoll
INDEX
        _atoll_r

SYNOPSIS
        #include <stdlib.h>
        long long atoll(const char *<[str]>);
        long long _atoll_r(struct _reent *<[ptr]>, const char *<[str]>);

DESCRIPTION
The function <<atoll>> converts the initial portion of the string 
pointed to by <<*<[str]>>> to a type <<long long>>.  A call to
atoll(str) in this implementation is equivalent to 
strtoll(str, (char **)NULL, 10) including behavior on error.

The alternate function <<_atoll_r>> is a reentrant version.  The
extra argument <[reent]> is a pointer to a reentrancy structure.


RETURNS
The converted value.

PORTABILITY
<<atoll>> is ISO 9899 (C99) and POSIX 1003.1-2001 compatable.

No supporting OS subroutines are required.
