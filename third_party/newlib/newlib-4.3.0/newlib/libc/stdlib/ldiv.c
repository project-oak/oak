/*
FUNCTION
<<ldiv>>---divide two long integers

INDEX
	ldiv

SYNOPSIS
	#include <stdlib.h>
	ldiv_t ldiv(long <[n]>, long <[d]>);

DESCRIPTION
Divide
@tex
$n/d$,
@end tex
@ifnottex
<[n]>/<[d]>,
@end ifnottex
returning quotient and remainder as two long integers in a structure <<ldiv_t>>.

RETURNS
The result is represented with the structure

. typedef struct
. {
.  long quot;
.  long rem;
. } ldiv_t;

where the <<quot>> field represents the quotient, and <<rem>> the
remainder.  For nonzero <[d]>, if `<<<[r]> = ldiv(<[n]>,<[d]>);>>' then
<[n]> equals `<<<[r]>.rem + <[d]>*<[r]>.quot>>'.

To divide <<int>> rather than <<long>> values, use the similar
function <<div>>.

PORTABILITY
<<ldiv>> is ANSI.

No supporting OS subroutines are required.
