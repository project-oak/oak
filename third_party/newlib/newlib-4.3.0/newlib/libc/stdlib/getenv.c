/*
FUNCTION
<<getenv>>---look up environment variable

INDEX
	getenv
INDEX
	environ

SYNOPSIS
	#include <stdlib.h>
	char *getenv(const char *<[name]>);

DESCRIPTION
<<getenv>> searches the list of environment variable names and values
(using the global pointer ``<<char **environ>>'') for a variable whose
name matches the string at <[name]>.  If a variable name matches,
<<getenv>> returns a pointer to the associated value.

RETURNS
A pointer to the (string) value of the environment variable, or
<<NULL>> if there is no such environment variable.

PORTABILITY
<<getenv>> is ANSI, but the rules for properly forming names of environment
variables vary from one system to another.

<<getenv>> requires a global pointer <<environ>>.
