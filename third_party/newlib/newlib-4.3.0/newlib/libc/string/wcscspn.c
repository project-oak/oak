/*
FUNCTION
	<<wcscspn>>---get length of a complementary wide substring 

SYNOPSIS
	#include <wchar.h>
	size_t wcscspn(const wchar_t *<[s]>, wchar_t *<[set]>);

DESCRIPTION
	The <<wcscspn>> function computes the length of the maximum initial
	segment of the wide-character string pointed to by <[s]> which consists
	entirely of wide-character codes not from the wide-character string
	pointed to by <[set]>. 

RETURNS
	The <<wcscspn>> function returns the length of the initial substring of
	<[s1]>; no return value is reserved to indicate an error.

PORTABILITY
<<wcscspn>> is ISO/IEC 9899/AMD1:1995 (ISO C).

No supporting OS subroutines are required.
