FUNCTION
        <<wcsnlen>>---get fixed-size wide-character string length
    
INDEX
        wcsnlen

SYNOPSIS
        #include <wchar.h>
        size_t wcsnlen(const wchar_t *<[s]>, size_t <[maxlen]>);

DESCRIPTION
        The <<wcsnlen>> function computes the number of wide-character codes
        in the wide-character string pointed to by <[s]> not including the
        terminating L'\0' wide character but at most <[maxlen]> wide
        characters.

RETURNS
        <<wcsnlen>> returns the length of <[s]> if it is less then <[maxlen]>,
        or <[maxlen]> if there is no L'\0' wide character in first <[maxlen]>
        characters.

PORTABILITY
<<wcsnlen>> is a GNU extension.

<<wcsnlen>> requires no supporting OS subroutines.
