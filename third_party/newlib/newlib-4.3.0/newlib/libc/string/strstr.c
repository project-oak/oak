FUNCTION
	<<strstr>>---find string segment

INDEX
	strstr

SYNOPSIS
	#include <string.h>
	char *strstr(const char *<[s1]>, const char *<[s2]>);

DESCRIPTION
	Locates the first occurrence in the string pointed to by <[s1]> of
	the sequence of characters in the string pointed to by <[s2]>
	(excluding the terminating null character).

RETURNS
	Returns a pointer to the located string segment, or a null
	pointer if the string <[s2]> is not found. If <[s2]> points to
	a string with zero length, <[s1]> is returned.

PORTABILITY
<<strstr>> is ANSI C.

<<strstr>> requires no supporting OS subroutines.

QUICKREF
	strstr ansi pure

/* Extremely fast strstr algorithm with guaranteed linear-time performance.
   Small needles up to size 4 use a dedicated linear search.  Longer needles
   up to size 254 use Sunday's Quick-Search algorithm.  Due to its simplicity
   it has the best average performance of string matching algorithms on almost
   all inputs.  It uses a bad-character shift table to skip past mismatches.
   By limiting the needle length to 254, the shift table can be reduced to 8
   bits per entry, lowering preprocessing overhead and minimizing cache effects.
   The limit also implies the worst-case performance is linear.
   Even larger needles are processed by the linear-time Two-Way algorithm.
