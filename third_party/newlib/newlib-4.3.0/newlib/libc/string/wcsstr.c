/*
FUNCTION
	<<wcsstr>>---find a wide-character substring 

SYNOPSIS
	#include <wchar.h>
	wchar_t *wcsstr(const wchar_t *__restrict <[big]>,
			const wchar_t *__restrict <[little]>);

DESCRIPTION
	The <<wcsstr>> function locates the first occurrence in the
	wide-character string pointed to by <[big]> of the sequence of
	wide characters (excluding the terminating null wide character) in the
	wide-character string pointed to by <[little]>.

RETURNS
	On successful completion, <<wcsstr>> returns a pointer to the located
	wide-character string, or a null pointer if the wide-character string
	is not found.

	If <[little]> points to a wide-character string with zero length,
	the function returns <[big]>.

PORTABILITY
<<wcsstr>> is ISO/IEC 9899/AMD1:1995 (ISO C).
