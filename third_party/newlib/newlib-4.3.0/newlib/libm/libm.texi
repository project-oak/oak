@node Reentrancy
@chapter Reentrancy Properties of @code{libm}

@cindex reentrancy
@cindex @code{matherr} and reentrancy
When a libm function detects an exceptional case, @code{errno} may be
set.

@c The exact behavior depends on the currently selected error handling 
@c mode (IEEE or POSIX).

@code{errno} is a macro which expands to the per-thread error value.
This makes it thread safe, and therefore reentrant.

@node Long Double Functions
@chapter The long double function support of @code{libm}
Currently, the full set of long double math functions is only provided
on platforms where long double equals double.
For such platforms, the long double math functions are implemented as calls to the double versions.
