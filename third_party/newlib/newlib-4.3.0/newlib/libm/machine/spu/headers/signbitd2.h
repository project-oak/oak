/*
 * FUNCTION
 *	vector unsigned long long _signbitd2(vector double x)
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *      The signbitd2 function returns a vector which contains either all ones 
 *      or all zeros, depending on the sign of the corresponding input vector 
 *      element.
 *
 *      Note that the signbit functions are not logically equivalent to 
 *      x < 0.0.  IEEE 754 floating point rules include a signed zero, so if
 *      the input value is â€“0.0, signbit will return non-zero, but the naive
 *      implementation will not.
 * 
 * RETURNS
 *      The function signbitf4 returns an unsigned int vector in which each
 *      element is defined as:
 *
 *        - ULLONG_MAX (0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF)   if the sign bit is set for the 
 *                                            corresponding element of x
 *        - 0          (0x0000000000000000)   otherwise.
