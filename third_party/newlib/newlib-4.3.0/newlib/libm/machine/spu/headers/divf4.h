 * FUNCTION

   *
   * 1) Computing the quotient to full single precision
   *    floating point accuracy.
   * 2) Round the result consistently with the rounding
   *    mode of the processor - truncated toward zero.
   * 3) Underflow and overflow results are clamped to
   *    Smin and Smax and flagged with the appropriate
   *    UNF or OVF exception in the FPSCR.
   * 4) Divide By Zero (DBZ) exception is produced when
   *    the divisor <b> has a zero exponent. A quotient
   *    of correctly signed Smax is produced.
   * 5) Denorm/zero divided by a denorm/zero generates 
   *    a DBZ with the results undefined.
   * 6) Resulting denorm quotients will be coerced to +0.
   * 7) If a non-compliant IEEE result is produced, the
   *    a DIFF exception is generated.
