This directory was an experiment to use floating-point operations to implement
the math library when a processor had a floating-point instruction set.  The
experiment was a failure in that some of the algorithms chosen (e.g. recursive
algorithms for sin/cos, etc..) are too simple and do not provide proper accuracy 
nor handle very large or very small inputs adequately.

The code is considered moth-balled.  The stable math library routines can be
found in libm/math and the configuration option to use this has been removed.

If you wish to experiment with the concept, please feel free and report back if
you have major improvements.
