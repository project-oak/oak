FUNCTION
        <<casin>>, <<casinf>>---complex arc sine

INDEX
        casin
INDEX
        casinf

SYNOPSIS
       #include <complex.h>
       double complex casin(double complex <[z]>);
       float complex casinf(float complex <[z]>);


DESCRIPTION
        These functions compute the complex arc sine of <[z]>,
        with branch cuts outside the interval [-1, +1] along the real axis.

        <<casinf>> is identical to <<casin>>, except that it performs
        its calculations on <<floats complex>>.

RETURNS
        @ifnottex
        These functions return the complex arc sine value, in the range
        of a strip mathematically  unbounded  along the imaginary axis
        and in the interval [-pi/2, +pi/2] along the real axis.
        @end ifnottex
        @tex
        These functions return the complex arc sine value, in the range
        of a strip mathematically  unbounded  along the imaginary axis
        and in the interval [$-\pi/2$, $+\pi/2$] along the real axis.
        @end tex

PORTABILITY
        <<casin>> and <<casinf>> are ISO C99

QUICKREF
        <<casin>> and <<casinf>> are ISO C99
