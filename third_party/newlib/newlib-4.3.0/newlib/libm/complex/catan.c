FUNCTION
        <<catan>>, <<catanf>>---complex arc tangent

INDEX
        catan
INDEX
        catanf

SYNOPSIS
       #include <complex.h>
       double complex catan(double complex <[z]>);
       float complex catanf(float complex <[z]>);


DESCRIPTION
        @ifnottex
        These functions compute the complex arc tangent of <[z]>,
        with branch cuts outside the interval [-i, +i] along the 
        imaginary axis.
        @end ifnottex
        @tex
        These functions compute the complex arc tangent of <[z]>,
        with branch cuts outside the interval [$-i$, $+i$] along the 
        imaginary axis.
        @end tex

        <<catanf>> is identical to <<catan>>, except that it performs
        its calculations on <<floats complex>>.

RETURNS
        @ifnottex
        These functions return the complex arc tangent value, in the range
        of a strip mathematically  unbounded  along the imaginary axis
        and in the interval [-pi/2, +pi/2] along the real axis.
        @end ifnottex
        @tex
        These functions return the complex arc tangent, in the range
        of a strip mathematically  unbounded  along the imaginary axis
        and in the interval [$-\pi/2$, $+\pi/2$] along the real axis.
        @end tex

PORTABILITY
        <<catan>> and <<catanf>> are ISO C99

QUICKREF
        <<catan>> and <<catanf>> are ISO C99
