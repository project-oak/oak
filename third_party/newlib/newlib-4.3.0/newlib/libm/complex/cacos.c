FUNCTION
        <<cacos>>, <<cacosf>>---complex arc cosine

INDEX
        cacos
INDEX
        cacosf

SYNOPSIS
       #include <complex.h>
       double complex cacos(double complex <[z]>);
       float complex cacosf(float complex <[z]>);


DESCRIPTION
        These functions compute the complex arc cosine of <[z]>,
        with branch cuts outside the interval [-1, +1] along the real axis.

        <<cacosf>> is identical to <<cacos>>, except that it performs
        its calculations on <<floats complex>>.

RETURNS
        @ifnottex
        These functions return the complex arc cosine value, in the range
        of a strip mathematically  unbounded  along the imaginary axis
        and in the interval [0, pi] along the real axis.
        @end ifnottex
        @tex
        These functions return the complex arc cosine value, in the range
        of a strip mathematically  unbounded  along the imaginary axis
        and in the interval [<<0>>, $\pi$] along the real axis.
        @end tex

PORTABILITY
        <<cacos>> and <<cacosf>> are ISO C99

QUICKREF
        <<cacos>> and <<cacosf>> are ISO C99
