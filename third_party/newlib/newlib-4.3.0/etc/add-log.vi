map  1GO:r !date '+\%Y-\%m-\%d'2GA  Jason Molenda  (:r !whoamikJxA@:r !hostnameA)kJxkddjO	* k$

It contains control and escape sequences, so don't just cut and paste it.
You'll need to change the "Jason Molenda" bit, of course. :-)  Put this
in your $HOME/.exrc and when you type control-X in move-around-mode,
you'll have a changelog template inserted.
