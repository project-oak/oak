<answer>

<para>If you have installed Cygwin, you can find lots of documentation in
<literal>/usr/share/doc/</literal>.  Some packages have Cygwin specific
instructions in a file
<literal>/usr/share/doc/Cygwin/<replaceable>package_name</replaceable>.README</literal>.
In addition, many packages ship with standard documentation, which you can
find in
<literal>/usr/share/doc/<replaceable>package_name</replaceable></literal> or
by using the <literal>man</literal> or <literal>info</literal> tools. (Hint:
use <literal>cygcheck -l <replaceable>package_name</replaceable></literal> to
list what man pages the package includes.)  Some older packages still keep
their documentation in <literal>/usr/doc/</literal>
instead of <literal>/usr/share/doc/</literal>.
</para>
<para>There are links to quite a lot of documentation on the main Cygwin
project web page, <ulink url="https://cygwin.com/"/>, including this FAQ.
Be sure to at least read any 'Release Notes' or 'Readme' or 'read this'
links on the main web page, if there are any.
