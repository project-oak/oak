<title>Quick Start Guide for those more experienced with UNIX</title>
<para>
If you are an experienced UNIX user who misses a powerful command-line
environment, you will enjoy Cygwin.
Developers coming from a UNIX background will find a set of utilities
they are already comfortable using, including a working UNIX shell.  The
compiler tools are the standard GNU compilers most people will have previously
used under UNIX, only ported to the Windows host.  Programmers wishing to port
UNIX software to Windows NT will find that the Cygwin library provides
an easy way to port many UNIX packages, with only minimal source code
changes.
</para>
<para>
Note that there are some workarounds that cause Cygwin to behave differently
than most UNIX-like operating systems; these are described in more detail in 
<xref linkend="using-effectively"></xref>.
</para>
<para>
Use the graphical command <command>setup.exe</command> any time you want
to update or install a Cygwin package.  This program must be run
manually every time you want to check for updated packages since Cygwin
does not currently include a mechanism for automatically detecting
package updates.
</para>
<para>
By default, <command>setup.exe</command> only installs a minimal subset of
packages.  Add any other packages by clicking on the <literal>+</literal>
next to the Category name and selecting the package from the displayed
list.  You may search for specfic tools by using the
<ulink url="https://cygwin.com/packages/">Setup Package Search</ulink>
at the Cygwin web site.
</para>
<para>
After installation, you can find Cygwin-specific documentation in
the <literal>/usr/share/doc/Cygwin/</literal> directory.
