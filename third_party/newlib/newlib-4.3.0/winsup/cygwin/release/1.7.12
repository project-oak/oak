What's new:
-----------

- Cygwin now automatically populates the /dev directory with all
  existing POSIX devices.

- Add virtual /proc/PID/mountinfo file.

- flock now additionally supports the following scenario, which requires
  to propagate locks to the parent process:

    (
      flock -n 9 || exit 1
      # ... commands executed under lock ...
    } 9>/var/lock/mylockfile

  Only propagation to the direct parent process is supported so far,
  not to grand parents or sibling processes.

- Add a "detect_bloda" setting for the CYGWIN environment variable to help
  finding potential BLODAs.
