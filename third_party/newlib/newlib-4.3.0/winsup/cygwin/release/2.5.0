  pthread_barrier_init, pthread_barrier_destroy, pthread_barrier_wait.

- Enabled console reports requested by escape sequences: Requesting primary
  and secondary device attributes, requesting cursor position report;

  acoshl, acosl, asinhl, asinl, atan2l, atanhl, atanl, cacoshl, cacosl, cargl,

  lroundl, modfl, nearbyintl, nextafterl, pow10l, powl, remainderl, remquol,
  roundl, scalbl, scalblnl, scalbnl, sincosl, sinhl, sinl, tanhl, tanl,

What changed:
-------------

- Including <sys/acl.h> now *only* includes the POSIX ACL API.  To include
  the old Solaris API, include <cygwin/acl.h>.

- In calls to chmod treat ACLs with extra ACEs *only* for Admins and
  SYSTEM like a trivial ACL.

- Bump POSIX option macros to POSIX.1-2008.

- Profiling data, specifically pc sampling, now covers all threads of a
  program and not just the main thread.  Environment variable GMON_OUT_PREFIX
  enables multiple gmon.out files to preserve profiling data after fork or
  from multiple program runs.

- Feature test macros, which control which symbols are exposed in the standard
  headers, have been completely overhauled for compatibility with glibc.

- The isinf, isinff, and isinfl functions are signed, returning -1 for
  negative infinity for compatibility with glibc.
