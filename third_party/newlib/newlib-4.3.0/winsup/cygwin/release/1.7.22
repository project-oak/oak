What's new:

What changed:
-----------

- Support for /dev/mem, /dev/kmem and /dev/port removed, since OS support
  was limited to 32 bit Windows XP only.

- Added cygwin GetCommandLine wrappers which will allow Cygwin programs to
  (appear to) use the Windows command line functions.

- regcomp(3) now allows character values >= 0x80 if the current codeset is
  ASCII (default codeset in the "C"/"POSIX" locale).  This allows patterns
  containing arbitrary byte values as GLibc's regcomp.

Bug fixes:
----------

- Fix an off-by-one error in path handling which made the access check
  for the existing path before a ".." component (introduced with 1.7.21)
  fail for UNC paths (//server/share/path).
  Fixes: http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2013-07/msg00375.html

- Fix long-standing problem which allows to access files via ".." using an
  invalid POSIX path, for instance, `cd nonexistant/../existing_dir".
  Fixes: http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2013-05/msg00222.html

- Fix an initialization bug in XSI IPC on, which could result in
  XSI IPC functions misbehave on x86_64.

- Fix a timer handle leak in sleep family of functions.
  Fixes: http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2013-07/msg00379.html

- Fix issue with raise() not causing the process to exit with a signal
  status.  Also only set "dumped core" flag when it's a "kernel" signal.
