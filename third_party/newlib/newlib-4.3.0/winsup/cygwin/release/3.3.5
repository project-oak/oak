- Fix some problems such as:
   1) If output of non-cygwin app and input of cygwin app are connected
      by a pipe, Ctrl-C has to be sent twice to stop apps when the
      cygwin app does not read stdin at the moment.
   2) In cmd.exe started from cygwin shell, if output of non-cygwin
      app and input of cygwin app are connected by a pipe, Ctrl-C
      can never terminate the apps.

- Fix exit code when non-cygwin app is terminated by Ctrl-C.

- Fix a bug that the order of the console key inputs are occasionally
  swapped, especially when CPU load is high.

  linux. fsync() should return EINVAL for special files such as tty.
