What changed:
-------------

- Windows 10 1803 or later and WSL installed:

  Starting with 3.0.0, mkdir(2) automatically created directories within
  the Cygwin installation dir as case sensitive.  This badly breaks
  interoperability with remote machines trying to access these dirs.
  Therefore, disable this as default.  You can still create case-sensitive
  dirs via `chattr +C ...'
