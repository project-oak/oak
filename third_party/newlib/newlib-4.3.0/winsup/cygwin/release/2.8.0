What's new:
-----------

- New API: timingsafe_bcmp, timingsafe_memcmp

- New API: dladdr

- New API: getloadavg


What changed:
-------------

- cygcheck and strace now always generate output with Unix LF line endings,
  rather than with DOS/Windows CR LF line endings.

- fork now preserves the load order of unrelated dlopen'd modules.

- pthread_cond_wait now acts like Linux and BSD: Resume waiting for the
  condition variable as if it was not interrupted, rather than returning 0.

- The internal <sys/_locale.h> header was renamed to <xlocale.h> for
  source compatibility with other systems.

- Try harder supporting Netapp drives.
