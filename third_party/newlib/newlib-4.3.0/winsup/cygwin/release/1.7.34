What's new:
-----------

- Cygwin can now generate passwd/group entries directly from Windows
  user databases (local SAM or Active Directory), thus allowing to run
  Cygwin without having to create /etc/passwd and /etc/group files.
  Introduce /etc/nsswitch.conf file to configure passwd/group handling.

  For bordercase which require to use /etc/passwd and /etc/group files,
  change mkpasswd/mkgroup to generate passwd/group entries compatible
  with the entries read from SAM/AD.

- Add -b/--remove-all option to setfacl to reduce the ACL to only the
  entries representing POSIX permission bits.

- Add -k/--remove-default option to setfacl to remove all default ACL
  entries from an ACL.

- Add restore action to regtool.

- Provide Cygwin documentation (PDFs and HTML) for offline usage in
  /usr/share/doc/cygwin-${version}.

- Make gethostbyname2 handle numeric host addresses as well as the reserved
  domain names "localhost" and "invalid" per RFC 6761.

- New APIs: qsort_r, __bsd_qsort_r.

- New API: wcstold.

- New APIs: __fbufsize, __flbf, __fpending, __freadable, __freading,
  __fsetlocking, __fwritable, __fwriting.

- New APIs: clearerr_unlocked, feof_unlocked, ferror_unlocked, fflush_unlocked,
  fgetc_unlocked, fgets_unlocked, fgetwc_unlocked, fgetws_unlocked,
  fileno_unlocked, fputc_unlocked, fputs_unlocked, fputwc_unlocked,
  fputws_unlocked, fread_unlocked, fwrite_unlocked, getwc_unlocked,
  getwchar_unlocked, putwc_unlocked, putwchar_unlocked.

- New API: sockatmark.


What changed:
-------------

- Revamp Solaris ACL implementation to more closely work like POSIX ACLs
  are supposed to work.  Finally implement a CLASS_OBJ emulation.  Update
  getfacl(1)/setfacl(1) accordingly.

- The xdr functions are no longer exported for newly built executables.
  Use libtirpc-devel instead.

- 32 bit only: Change default values for socket buffer size to raise
  performance on 10Gb networks.

- When spawning a process under another user account, merge the user's
  default Windows environment into the new process' environment.


Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix the problem that ptys master side always writes single byte packages
  to the slave side, and pty slaves always read VMIN byte packages from
  the master side if VMIN is > 0.
