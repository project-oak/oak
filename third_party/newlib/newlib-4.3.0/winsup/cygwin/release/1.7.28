What's new:
-----------

- popen now supports the Glibc 'e' flag to set the FD_CLOEXEC flag on the pipe
  in a thread-safe way.

- netinet/ip6.h header.


What changed:
-------------

- Switch to BSD FILE stream fopen/exit semantics, as in all BSD variants and
  Linux/GLibc:  Don't fflush/lseek a FILE stream on fclose and exit, if it
  only has been read from.
