What's new:
-----------

- /proc/cygdrive is a new symlink pointing to the current cygdrive prefix.
  This can be utilized in scripts to access paths via cygdrive prefix, even
  if the cygdrive prefix has been changed by the user.

- /proc/partitions now prints the windows mount points the device is mounted
  on.  This allows to recognize the underlying Windows devices of the Cygwin
  raw device names.

- New API: quotactl, designed after the Linux/BSD function, but severely
  restricted:  Windows only supports user block quotas on NTFS, no group
  quotas, no inode quotas, no time constraints.

- New APIs: ffsl, ffsll (glibc extensions).

- New API: stime (SVr4).


What changed:
-------------

- New internal exception handling based on SEH on 64 bit Cygwin.

- When exec'ing applications, check if $PATH exists and is non-empty.  If not,
  add PATH variable with Cygwin installation directory as content to Windows
  environment to allow loading of Cygwin system DLLs.

- Disable CYGWIN "dosfilewarning" option by default.

- Improve various header files for C++- and standards-compliance.

- Doug Lea malloc implementation update from 2.8.3 to the latest 2.8.6.

- atexit is now exported as statically linked function from libcygwin.a.
  This allows reliable access to the DSO handle of the caller for newly
  built executables.  The former atexit entry point into the DLL remains
  for backward compatibility only.


Bug Fixes
---------

- Per POSIX, dirfd(3) now returns EINVAL rather than EBADF on invalid
  directory stream.

- Fix a resource leak in rmdir(2).

- Fix fchmod(2)/fchown(2)/fsetxattr(2) in case the file got renamed after
  open and before calling one of the affected functions.

  Addresses: https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin-developers/2014-10/msg00010.html

- Don't hang in accept calls if socket is no listener.  Set errno to EINVAL
  instead.

  instead.
  Addresses: https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2014-08/msg00319.html

- Fix a SEGV in cygcheck if the environment variable COMSPEC is not, or
  incorrectly set.
  Addresses: https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2014-10/msg00292.html

- Fix a SEGV in some 64 bit applications explicitely dlclosing DLLs.
  Addresses: https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2014-10/msg00402.html

- Fix -fuse-cxa-atexit handling where dlclose fails to trigger calling
  global dtors in dynamically loaded modules in C++ applications (and
  thus another potential SEGV).
