What's new:
-----------

- Add 24 bit color support using xterm compatibility mode in Windows 10
  1703 or later.  Add fake 24 bit color support for legacy console,
  which uses the nearest color from 16 system colors.

- Support pseudo console in PTY. Pseudo console is a new feature
  in Windows 10 1809, which provides console APIs on virtual
  terminal. With this patch, native console applications can work
  in PTYs such as mintty, ssh, gnu screen or tmux.

- New APIs: sched_getaffinity, sched_setaffinity, pthread_getaffinity_np,
  pthread_setaffinity_np, plus CPU_SET macros.

- New APIs: dbm_clearerr, dbm_close, dbm_delete, dbm_dirfno, dbm_error,
  dbm_fetch, dbm_firstkey, dbm_nextkey, dbm_open, dbm_store.

- If a SA_SIGINFO signal handler changes the ucontext_t pointed to by
  the third parameter, follow it after returning from the handler.

- Eliminate a header file name collision with <X11/XLocale.h> on case
  insensitive filesystems by reverting <xlocale.h> back to <sys/_locale.h>.

- Allow times(2) to have a NULL argument, as on Linux.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix select() on console in canonical mode.  Return after one line is
  completed, instead of when only one key is typed.

- Make console I/O functions thread-safe.

- Define missing MSG_EOR.  It's unsupported by the underlying Winsock
  layer so using it in send(2), sendto(2), or sendmsg(2) will return -1
  with errno set to EOPNOTSUPP and recvmsg(2) will never return it.

- Fix a timerfd deadlock.
