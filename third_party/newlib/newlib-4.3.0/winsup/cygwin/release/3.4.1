---------

  becoming disfunctional.
  Addresses: https://cygwin.com/pipermail/cygwin/2022-December/252619.html

- Fix a backward incompatibility problem in the definition of the
  base type of the stdio type FILE.  This requires that C++ binaries
  compiled under Cygwin 3.4.0 having a public facing interface using
  FILE need to be recompiled.
