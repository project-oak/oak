What's new:
-----------

- getaddrinfo now supports glibc-specific International Domain Name (IDN)
  extension flags: AI_IDN, AI_CANONIDN, AI_IDN_ALLOW_UNASSIGNED,
  AI_IDN_USE_STD3_ASCII_RULES.

- getnameinfo now supports glibc-specific International Domain Name (IDN)
  extension flags: NI_IDN, NI_IDN_ALLOW_UNASSIGNED, NI_IDN_USE_STD3_ASCII_RULES.

- Preliminary, experimental support of the posix_spawn family of functions.
  New associated header /usr/include/spawn.h.


What changed:
-------------

- Slightly improve randomness of /dev/random emulation.

- Allow to use advisory locking on any device.  POSIX fcntl and lockf locking
  works with any device, BSD flock locking only with devices backed by an OS
  handle.  Right now this excludes console windows on pre Windows 8, as well as
  almost all virtual files under /proc from BSD flock locking.

- The header /usr/include/exceptions.h, containing implementation details for
  32 bit Windows' exception handling only, has been removed.


Bug fixes:
----------

- pthread_atparent hook should not be called in the child.
  Fixes: http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2013-09/msg00365.html

- 64 bit only:  Correctly mmap'ing regions > 4 Gigs.
  Fixes: http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2013-09/msg00155.html

- Fix random content of /proc/$PID/ctty if the process has no controlling
  tty.  Set to just "\n" instead.

- Properly set process sid rather than always using -1.
  Fixes: http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2013-10/threads.html#00237 

- Fix a potential crash after calling lseek on /dev/clipboard.

- Fix a handle inheritance bug in raw disk and tape device handling which
  led to EBADF errors in child processes.

- open("/dev", O_CREAT) accidentally created a /dev file if no /dev
  exists at the time.

- DIR *d = opendir ("foo"); flock (dirfd (d), ...); worked, but did the
  wrong thing.

- Reading from /dev/windows was broken for some time.

- select'ing on /dev/windows accidentally didn't take the setting of
  ioctl (WINDOWS_HWND) into account.

- Fix typos in cygcheck which could crash Windows 8 and 8.1 machines.
  Fixes: http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2013-11/msg00334.html

- Show OS version correctly even on Windows 8.1 and Server 2012 R2.
  Fixes: http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2013-11/msg00343.html

- dup2() could crash in some cases for a destination >= 256
  Fixes: http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2013-09/msg00397.html

- Try to workaround the following problem: unlink(2) could fail, if the
  file was opened casesensitive and has to be moved to the recycler due
  to a sharing violation.
