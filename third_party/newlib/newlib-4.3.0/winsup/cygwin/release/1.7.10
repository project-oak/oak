What's new:
-----------

- New getconf tool for querying confstr(3), pathconf(3), sysconf(3), and
  limits.h configuration.

- New tzset utility to generate a POSIX-compatible TZ environment
  variable from the Windows timezone settings.

- The passwd tool now allows an administrator to use the -R command for
  other user accounts:  passwd -R username.

- Experimental: Change the way sockets are created so that Cygwin always
  circumvents so-called "layered service providers" (LSPs) starting with
  Windows Vista.

- signal handler functions are now dispatched in threads other than the
  main thread.

- Support NcFsd filesystem.

- clock_gettime(3) and clock_getres(3) accept per-process and per-thread
  CPU-time clocks, including CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID and
  CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID.

- New pthread functions:

  - Spin Locks: pthread_spin_destroy, pthread_spin_init, pthread_spin_lock,
    pthread_spin_trylock, pthread_spin_unlock.

  - Stack management: pthread_attr_getstack, pthread_attr_getstackaddr,
    pthread_attr_getguardsize, pthread_attr_setstack, pthread_attr_setstackaddr,
    pthread_attr_setguardsize, pthread_getattr_np.
  
  - Clock Selection: pthread_getcpuclockid, pthread_condattr_getclock,
    pthread_condattr_setclock.

  - Scheduling: pthread_setschedprio.

  - Signalling: pthread_sigqueue.

- Add /proc/devices, /proc/misc, /proc/sysvipc, /proc/swaps.

- Make various system functions thread cancelation points per POSIX.

- Add ioctl FIONREAD handling for non-sockets.

- dlopen now supports the Glibc-specific RTLD_NODELETE and RTLD_NOOPEN flags.

- The printf and wprintf families of functions now support the %m conversion
  flag.

- Execed processes now inherit the children of their predecessor.

- Fifos have been rewritten and should now be more reliable.

- GNU/glibc error.h error reporting functions: error, error_at_line,
  error_message_count, error_one_per_line, error_print_progname.

- C99 <tgmath.h> type-generic macros.

- Other new API: clock_getcpuclockid, clock_nanosleep, clock_settime, __fpurge,
  get_current_dir_name, getgrouplist, getpt, ppoll, psiginfo, psignal,
  ptsname_r, sys_siglist, sysinfo.

- cygwin_conv_path_list finally supports CCP_WIN_W_TO_POSIX and
  CCP_POSIX_TO_WIN_W conversions.


What changed:
-------------

- Drop support for Windows NT4.

- The CYGWIN=tty mode using pipes to communicate with the console in a pseudo
  tty-like mode has been removed.  Either just use the normal Windows console
  as is, or use a terminal application like mintty.

- The CYGWIN environment variable options "envcache", "strip_title", "title",
  "tty", and "upcaseenv" have been removed.

- New heap management.  Drop registry setting "heap_chunk_in_mb" in favor of
  a new per-executable setting in the executable file header which can be set
  using the peflags tool.  Drop registry setting "heap_slop_in_mb" entirely.

- Revamp console and pseudo tty handling.  Rename /dev/ttyX to /dev/consX,
  /dev/ttyX to /dev/ptyX.

- Improve fork/exec performance on 64 bit systems.

- Improve Ctrl-C handling in console.

- Try harder to let fork not fail if DLLs are moved in memory which should,
  in some cases, minimize the need for rebaseall.

- Try harder to send SIGHUP to children when process group leader fails.

- Deal with Windows problem where non-blocking pipe I/O was not flushed
  properly on close.

- Attempt to regularize most syscall-related strace output.

- Improve behavior of Cygwin when started from a 64-bit process, especially
  under Windows 2003.

- Improve multi-thread/reentrancy safety with syscalls that deal with fds.

- dlopen can now find "cygFOO.dll", even if the caller specified "libFOO.so".
  This is supposed to support applications which are no aware of Windows DLLs.

- Make accept(2), poll(2) and shutdown(2) behave more like on Linux.

- Raise max number of mount points from 30 to 64.

- Output of /proc/maps is closer to what Linux prints and much more useful to
  examine process VM layout.

- /proc/loadavg now shows the number of currently running processes and the
  total number of processes.

- /proc/version now shows the username of whomever compiled the Cygwin DLL
  as well as the version of GCC used when compiling.

- Various assorted bugfixes and improvements.

- Preliminary, no guarantee, may be broken in subtle ways, Windows 8 support.
