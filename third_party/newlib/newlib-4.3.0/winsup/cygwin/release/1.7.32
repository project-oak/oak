What's new:
-----------

- Export __cxa_atexit and __cxa_finalize to allow C++ standards-compliant
  destructor handling in libstdc++ and g++ compiled code.

  Please note that, in order to benefit from this new feature, C++ code
  must be recompiled with the upcoming gcc 4.8.3-3 release which will
  enable the -fuse-cxa-atexit flag by default, and that C++ applications
  using this feature will not run on older Cygwin releases.

- Support more recent CPU flags in /proc/cpuinfo.


Bug Fixes
---------

- Decorate attribute names with __, for namespace safety in various header
  files.
