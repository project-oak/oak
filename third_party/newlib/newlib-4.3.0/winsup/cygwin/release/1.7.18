What's new:
-----------

- For performance reasons, Cygwin does not try to create sparse files
  automatically anymore, unless you use the new "sparse" mount option.

- Added Windows console cursor appearance support:

  - Show/Hide Cursor mode (DECTCEM): "ESC[?25h" / "ESC[?25l"

  - Set cursor style (DECSCUSR): "ESC[n q" (note the space before the q);
    where n is 0, 1, 2 for block cursor, 3, 4 for underline cursor (all
    disregarding blinking mode), or > 4 to set the cursor height to a
    percentage of the cell height.

- New API: cfsetspeed.

- Changes in cygwin1.dll and gdb-7.5.50-2 now allow gdb to recognize
  Cygwin-specific signals like "SIGTERM" as well as Windows signals like
  "SIGSEGV".  This feature is still experimental.

Bug fixes:
----------

- Fix handle leak in rewinddir(3).  This affected Windows 2000 only.

- Allow quoted filenames in @ argument expression when called from native
  processes.  Fixes http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2012-12/msg00276.html

- Fix a bug in initializing the stdio settings at process startup, which
  could result in missing output.
  Fixes http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2013-01/msg00008.html

- rename("dir1", "dir2") could result in deleting dir2, even if the rename
  didn't take place, for instance, if dir1 and dir2 were not on the same
  device.

- rename("file1", "file2") would fail in almost all cases on NFS, due to a
  bug in the NFS driver's implementation of the FileRenameInformation info
  class.

- Fix bug where dup2 segv'ed on negative fd.
  See: http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2012-12/msg00377.html

- Work around problem of erratic exit codes caused by a thread exiting
  while process is shutting down.
  See: http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2012-12/msg00377.html

- Always interrupt select() on a signal.
  See: http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2013-01/threads.html#00139

- Fix "error while loading shared libraries:" message to properly
  display the shared library name in more cases.

- Fix unreported problem of exec'ed and spawn'ed processes not
  inheriting the signal mask of their "parents".

- Fix race in signal mask detection with new thread creation.
