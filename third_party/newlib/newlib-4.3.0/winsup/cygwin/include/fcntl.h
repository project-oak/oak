/* F_LCK_MANDATORY: Request mandatory locks for this file descriptor.

   Cygwin extension to fcntl file locking mechanism.  By default, fcntl file
   locks are advisory locks.  This works nicely as long as only Cygwin
   processes interact.  If you have the requirement to interact with native
   Windows applications which use Windows mandatory file locking, your have
   to use mandatory locking as well.  The command

   fcntl (fd, F_LCK_MANDATORY, 1)

   switches subsequent F_GETLK, F_SETLK, F_SETLKW calls to mandatory locking
   for this file descriptor and subsequently duplicated ones WITHIN THE SAME
   PROCESS.  Note that mandatory locks are NOT inherited by child processes,
   nor do they survive an execve call.  This fully corresponds to Windows
   mandatory locking semantics. */
