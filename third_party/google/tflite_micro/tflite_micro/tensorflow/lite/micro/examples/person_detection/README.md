# Person detection example

This example shows how you can use Tensorflow Lite to run a 250 kilobyte neural
network to recognize people in images.

## Run the tests on a development machine

```
make -f tensorflow/lite/micro/tools/make/Makefile third_party_downloads
make -f tensorflow/lite/micro/tools/make/Makefile test_person_detection_test
```

You should see a series of files get compiled, followed by some logging output
from a test, which should conclude with `~~~ALL TESTS PASSED~~~`. If you see
this, it means that a small program has been built and run that loads a trained
TensorFlow model, runs some example images through it, and got the expected
outputs. This particular test runs images with a and without a person in them,
and checks that the network correctly identifies them.

To understand how TensorFlow Lite does this, you can look at
[person_detection_test.cc](person_detection_test.cc).

## Training your own model

You can train your own model with some easy-to-use scripts. See
[training_a_model.md](training_a_model.md) for instructions.
