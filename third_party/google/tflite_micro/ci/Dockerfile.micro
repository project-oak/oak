# This docker container can be used to run all the TFLM CI checks.
#
# It is only used as part of the GitHub workflows to test for code-style. But
# the container is available and ready for use to run all the checks locally,
# in case that is useful for debugging. See all the versions at
# https://github.com/users/TFLM-bot/packages/container/tflm-ci/versions
#
# docker pull ghcr.io/tflm-bot/tflm-ci:<version>
#
# Build you own container with:
# docker build -f ci/Dockerfile.micro -t tflm-ci .
#
# Use a prebuilt Python image instead of base Ubuntu to speed up the build process,
# since it has all the build dependencies we need for Micro and downloads much faster
# than the install process.
