# Called with following arguments:
# 1 - OPTIMIZED_KERNEL_PATH (relative to the location from which the script is invoked)
#     to the optimized kernel implementations.
#
# This script is called from the Makefile and uses the following convention to
# enable determination of sucess/failure:
#
#   - If the script is successful, the only output on stdout should be SUCCESS.
#     The makefile checks for this particular string.
#
#   - Any string on stdout that is not SUCCESS will be shown in the makefile as
#     the cause for the script to have failed.
#
#   - Any other informational prints should be on stderr.
