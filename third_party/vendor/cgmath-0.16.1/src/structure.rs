/// # use cgmath::{Point3, Vector3};
/// #
/// # let p0 = Point3::new(1.0, 2.0, 3.0);
/// # let p1 = Point3::new(-3.0, 1.0, 2.0);
/// #
/// let dv: Vector3<f32> = p1 - p0;
/// let half_dv: Vector3<f32> = dv * 0.5;
/// let midpoint: Point3<f32> = p0 + half_dv;
/// ```
///
/// ## Converting between points and vectors
///
/// Points can be converted to and from displacement vectors using the
/// `EuclideanSpace::{from_vec, to_vec}` methods. Note that under the hood these
/// are implemented as inlined a type conversion, so should not have any
/// performance implications.
