This crate contains code extracted from the Rust Hypervisor Firmware code base:
https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/rust-hypervisor-firmware

Rust Hypervisor Firmware is, as the name suggests, designed to be firmware for
virtual machines that is able to load other kernels. The code here is the subset
