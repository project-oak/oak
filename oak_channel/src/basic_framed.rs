//! Basic framed format for use before the channel is handed off to the
//! application.
//!
//! Depending on configuration, this protocol is used twice.
//! 1. To load the application. Here the host is the sender, enclave is the
//!    recipient.
//! 2. [Optional]: to return the attestation evidence. Here the host is the
//!    recipient, enclave is the sender.
//!
//! The protocol is very simple:
//! 1. sender sends the size of the payload, as u32
//! 2. sender sends MAX_SIZE of data and waits for the recipient to acknowledge
//! 3. recipient reads up to MAX_SIZE of data and acks by responding with the
//!    amount of data read
//! 4. repeat (2) and (3) until all the data has been transmitted
