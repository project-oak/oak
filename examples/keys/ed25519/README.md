# Example keys

These sample keys (`test.key`, `test.pub`) are intended to be used as example
keys for testing.

In order to create a new pair of public/private keys, run the following command:

```bash
./scripts/oak_sign generate \
  --private-key=./examples/keys/ed25519/test.key \
  --public-key=./examples/keys/ed25519/test.pub
```
