# Node.js client example

Run this example with the following command:

```bash
./scripts/docker_run ./scripts/runner --logs run-examples --example-name=hello_world
```

If everything works smoothly, you should then find `HELLO Node.js!` logged to
the console, alongside logs from the Oak application and from other clients.
