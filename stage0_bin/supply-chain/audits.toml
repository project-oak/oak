Inspection reveals that the crate in question does not attempt to implement any
cryptographic algorithms on its own.

Note that certification of this does not require an expert on all forms of
cryptography: it's expected for crates we import to be \"good enough\" citizens,
so they'll at least be forthcoming if they try to implement something
cryptographic. When in doubt, please ask an expert."""

Code is well commented and unsafe blocks generally have comments regarding safety.
No obvious security issues uncovered.

I reviewed the RDRAND implementation most closely, as this is what is used in oak_core & stage0.
Implementations for other targets appear to be safe to deploy.
I would not consider this crate to be implementing crypto algorithms itself.
However, outside of RDRAND and js I'm not equipped to evaluate the trustworthiness of the random number generation itself.

Therefore, I would not necessarily endorse this crate as a safe primitive for implementing crypo algorithms using its random number generation.
