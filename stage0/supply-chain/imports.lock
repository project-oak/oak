Inspection reveals that the crate in question does not attempt to implement any
cryptographic algorithms on its own.

so they'll at least be forthcoming if they try to implement something
cryptographic. When in doubt, please ask an expert."""

`quote` is a utility crate used by proc-macros to generate TokenStreams
conveniently from source code. The bulk of the logic is some complex
interlocking `macro_rules!` macros which are used to parse and build the
`TokenStream` within the proc-macro.

This crate contains no unsafe code, and the internal logic, while difficult to
read, is generally straightforward. I have audited the the quote macros, ident
formatter, and runtime logic.
