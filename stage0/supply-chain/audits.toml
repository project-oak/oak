description = """
All crypto algorithms in this crate have been reviewed by a relevant expert.

**Note**: If a crate does not implement crypto, use `does-not-implement-crypto`,
which implies `crypto-safe`, but does not require expert review in order to
audit for."""

description = """
Inspection reveals that the crate in question does not attempt to implement any
cryptographic algorithms on its own.

Note that certification of this does not require an expert on all forms of
cryptography: it's expected for crates we import to be \"good enough\" citizens,
so they'll at least be forthcoming if they try to implement something
cryptographic. When in doubt, please ask an expert."""
