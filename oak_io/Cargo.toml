[features]
# Make handles linear.
# At the expense of making them non-copy, this causes handles to be
# automaticaly dropped, so that channels cannot accidentally linger on.
linear-handles = []
# For crates that explicitly do NOT support linear-handles yet (e.g. Oak SDK)
# If this crate is compiled with both features, linear-handles suppport is
# disabled.
# When compiling individual crates this would not be needed, but compiling an
# entire workspace with just one crate enabling 'linear-handles' will also
# enable it for all crates in that workspace, due to a quirk in Cargo.
