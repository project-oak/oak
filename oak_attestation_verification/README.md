# Oak Attestation Verification

This crate provides functionality for verifying remote attestation evidence
generated by Oak remote attestation protocol.

## Verifying BinaryAttestation

The `AttestationEndorsement` that an Oak client receives from the launcher
contains a `BinaryAttestation` field that carries an endorsement statement
generated by the Oak transparent release process and a Rekor log entry as the
proof of inclusion of the endorsement statement in Rekor (the transparency log
we use).

Verifying the `BinaryAttestation` includes the following steps:

1. Verifying the signature over the Rekor log entry (i.e., the log entry's
   `signedEntryTimestamp` filed), using Rekor's public key to ensure that it is
   indeed generated by Rekor.
1. Verifying that the signature in the body of the Rekor log entry is over the
   endorsement statement, and that the signature is produced by Oak. Doing this
   requires having Oak's public key, or a certificate chain that proves the
   public key belongs to Oak.
1. Verifying that the SHA256 hash of the binary in the subject of the
   endorsement statement must be the same as the hash of the remote server
   binary (received in the remote attestation report).
