# These certificates are the root of trust of the AMD hardware verification
# chain: ARK -> ASK -> VCEK -> attestation report. The ARK and and ASK
# certificates are parameter-free (with the exception of the chip generation
# which is called `product name` elsewhere). They are valid until 2045 and
# can therefore be statically included. Since they are static it is sufficient
# to verify the ARK -> ASK validity offline in a unit test.
#
# To verify ARK, redownload from https://www.amd.com/en/developer/sev.html and
# convert and compare against the repository copies.
