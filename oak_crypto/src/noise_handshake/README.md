# Noise protocol handshake

This is a port from Google's internal enclave app repo, which was approved for
open sourcing.

- [The noise framework](http://www.noiseprotocol.org/noise.html)
- [Noise explorer](https://noiseexplorer.com/patterns/NK/]

In general, when communicating secrets to an enclave, it is recommended to use
one of the well-reviewed noise variants for multi-round communication between
clients and servers, and HPKE for launch-and-forget style requests.

Currently only noise-NK is supported, but a future PR is planned for adding
noise-NN support.
