# Logging via the log crate is disabled and only available using our own custom logger that
# implements the OakLogger trait defined in oak_functions/logger/src/lib.rs.
#
# This is done to avoid accidentally leaking information logged by dependencies and allow code
# to differentiate between public and potentially sensitive log messages.
# TODO(#2783): Re-enable logging via the log crate once the logging approach has been redisigned.
