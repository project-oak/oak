# Oak Functions

The objective of Oak Functions is to design and implement a general-purpose
computing platform that allows developing stateless applications in a privacy
preserving way. Oak Functions leverages TEEs and remote attestation, Wasm
sandboxing, and allows exposing metrics in a Differentially Private way.

The main building blocks used in Oak Functions are:

- A Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)
  - This protects the data from the host, other enclaves and processes, and even
    some HW attacks.
  - TEEs can be VM-based (e.g., AMD SEV) or HW-backed (e.g., Intel SGX). Either
    variant can be used for hosting an Oak Functions application.
- Sandboxing the workload, currently using WebAssembly
  - The TEE protects from the host, and anything malicious on it, but to prevent
    malicious behavior in the code itself we need to sandbox the code and limit
    its privileges.
- Remote Attestation
  - So that the client can ensure that it is interacting with a legitimate and
    trustworthy instance of Oak Functions trusted runtime.

The following diagram shows how the computing model of Oak Functions differs
from the conventional computing model.

## Features

### Oak Functions Loader and the Trusted Runtime

[The Oak Functions loader](https://project-oak.github.io/oak/oak_functions/loader)
is responsible for starting the Oak Functions trusted runtime, and loading an
application, with a single Wasm module as the workload. An application may
specify additional resources in a server configuration file. These resources are
as well loaded by the Oak Functions loader at the startup time. The trusted
runtime instantiates the given Wasm module for each incoming user request, runs
the request through it in order to produce a response, and then terminates the
Wasm instance; each Wasm instance is short lived and stateless.

As part of our shift to a distributed runtime, in the future, we may allow
native Oak Functions instances that do not run any untrusted Wasm code. An
example is a native Oak Functions instance for collecting differentially private
metrics, deployed on its own TEE instances.

### ABI Functions and the Rust SDK

WebAssembly is very restricted. In order to be able to implement meaningful
applications in a secure way, the trusted runtime provides a number of ABI
functions. The ABI functions allow reading the incoming request, writing the
response, writing log messages, and fetching items from an in-memory storage. In
addition, there are experimental features for publishing metrics, and
machine-learning inference using a TensorFlow model. The full description of the
ABI functions can be found
[here](https://github.com/project-oak/oak/blob/main/docs/oak_functions_abi.md).

A Rust SDK is currently available, and support for other languages may be added
in the future.

### Read-Only Storage

The trusted runtime does not allow the Wasm logic to interact with any external
resources. However, each Oak Functions application can have a read-only storage
that is populated with data from an external data source at the startup time.
The external resource has to be specified in the server configuration file. It
is also possible to specify a refresh interval. This allows the Oak Functions
loader to periodically refresh the data in the storage, by re-downloading the
entirety of the data from a URL provided in the server configuration file.

The storage is implemented as an in-memory key-value store (in practice a
hashmap), of which there is one instance per Oak Functions trusted runtime
instance, which is shared across invocations of the Wasm logic. The property
that this offers is that queries are not observable (and not logged) by the
trusted runtime, since they happen within the same process, which eventually is
going to be contained in a single TEE instance. Oak Functions provides a
[lookup API](https://github.com/project-oak/oak/blob/main/docs/oak_functions_abi.md#storage_get_item)
that the Wasm modules can use to fetch data from the storage.

### Policies

The server configuration specifies a policy with fields for various
privacy-related parameters. Currently these parameters specify a fixed size for
responses returned by the trusted runtime, and a fixed processing time. The
policy is used to avoid side channel leaks (e.g., an outside attacker observing
the processing time of a request). The Oak Functions trusted runtime guarantees
that processing every request takes approximately the specified amount of time
and results in a response of exactly the specified size. If processing an
incoming request completes before the specified time in the policy, the response
will not be sent back until the time is elapsed. On the other hand, if
processing the request does not finish within this deadline, the trusted runtime
terminates the process early and responds with an error. Note that we can only
guarantee an approximation of the specified processing time, because the actual
processing time is affected by factors beyond the specific Wasm logic invoked by
the incoming request. These factors include the general serverâ€™s state, and how
busy it is overall. Therefore the variation in the actual processing time is in
fact random noise and cannot be used to leak information about the request via
the specific Wasm logic it invoked.

The configuration may in addition specify parameters related to differentially
private metrics, if that feature is enabled. These parameters include a list of
events, a batch size and an epsilon parameter for computing a Laplacian noise.
If metrics are enabled, the trusted runtime collects event counts for events
specified in the configuration, and aggregates them after the batch size is
reached. A laplacian noise, calculated using the specified epsilon parameter, is
then added to the aggregated value, to conform to the differential privacy
requirements, before publishing the results by logging to stdout.

### Remote Attestation

The Remote Attestation protocol implemented in Oak is currently integrated in
Oak Functions.

## Comparison with Oak

Oak Functions is a stripped-down version of Oak, and has borrowed many ideas
from Oak, but is different from Oak in a few ways that are described in this
section.

### Number of Wasm Modules

While an Oak application may have more than one Wasm module, each Oak Functions
application can have only one Wasm module.

Structurally, an Oak Functions application is very similar to a single-node Oak
application. This simplifies the design considerably. Since there is only one
Oak node (i.e., Wasm module), and the native APIs are no longer implemented as
pseudo-nodes, there is no need for message passing over channels. As a
consequence, we no longer require information flow control (IFC) to police the
flow of data from one node to another. The developers do not have to deal with
IFC labels or more advanced concepts and patterns.

Similar to Oak, we have implemented several layers of defense in depth. In
particular, application owners can control which functionalities to enable in a
server configuration file.

### No external interaction and read-only storage

An Oak application can have restricted interactions with the external world via
gRPC and HTTP pseudo-nodes. There is no equivalent functionality in an Oak
Functions application. Instead, as described above, each Oak Functions
application can have a read-only storage that can be refreshed periodically. The
trusted runtime offers a
[lookup API](https://github.com/project-oak/oak/blob/main/docs/oak_functions_abi.md#storage_get_item)
for fetching data from the storage.

## Applications

The assumption is that Oak Functions only covers a subset of the use cases
compared to Oak, but those use cases are the most commonly occurring ones. One
apparent restriction is the use of a read-only in-memory storage. With a
distributed runtime, however, it should be possible to use Oak Functions for
applications that require a larger storage.

We have an experimental support for ML-inference using TensorFlow models in Oak
Functions. The benefit of this, compared to running ML-inference on-device, is
that the model will remain protected and secure.
