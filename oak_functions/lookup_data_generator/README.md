# Lookup Data Generator

The binary in this directory generates and serializes a list of entries with
configurable key and value size, to be used to benchmark and test the lookup
functionality of the Oak Functions platform.

See
[`generate_and_upload_lookup_data`](/scripts/generate_and_upload_lookup_data)
for an example use.
