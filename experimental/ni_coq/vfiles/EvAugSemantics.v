(*
The top-level security condition compares traces involving both states (as
in "state" in RuntimeModel.v) and events. This file augments the semantics 
in RuntimeModel.v with rules that also produce labeled Events (in Events.v)
that represent values that are inputs/outputs to/from nodes. It also builds
traces that are sequences of pairs of states and events. In the future,
events will also represent downgrades of values. These events are abstract
objects that are used in the specification of the security condition.

The "input" event during the read is the one that is really strictly needed.
The model of a node does not contain any state corresponding to values.
So a purely state-based security condition would not say anything about values
that are read by a node.

I considered whether traces can be JUST sequences of events
rather than sequences of state/event pairs. I think the answer is no
because then it might be possible to leak information via
the handles a node has. (Even though the call of a node does not contain
informtion because the choice of call is always essentially non-deterministic,
so the call is a piece of state that probably does not matter at the moment)

 When downgrades events are added, a trace might need to be
 list (state * (Ensemble event))                  (Ensembles are sets)
 rather than
 list (state * event)
 since individual calls might produce more than one event. For example,
 when a read call does a declassification it would produce an input event
 and a downgrade event.
