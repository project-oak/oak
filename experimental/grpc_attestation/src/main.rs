//! gRPC Attestation Service implementation.
//!
//! gRPC Attestation Service performs remote attestation for each incoming streaming gRPC request.
//!
//! It is assumed that prior to the attestation workflow Service remotely attests its TEE platform
//! key with the TEE firmware Provider. Provider sends back a signature rooted in some well-known
//! root key (e.g. AMD root key), thus confirming the authenticity of the TEE platform key.
//!
//! Remote attestation is done as follows:
//! - Client generates an ephemeral (single-use) private/public key pair
//! - Client sends a streaming gRPC request with its public key to the Server
//! - Server generates an ephemeral (single-use) private/public key pair
//! - Server uses its and Client's public keys to generate a symmetric session key, which is shared
//!   between client and server
//! - Server puts the hash of its public key into the TEE report request
//!   - It means that when a TEE report is signed, the public key will also be signed
//! - Server requests a TEE report from the TEE firmware
//! - Server sends its public key, a TEE report and Provider's certificate to the Client
//! - Client checks the validity of the TEE report
//!   - It checks that the TEE report is signed by TEE Providerâ€™s root key
//!   - It checks that the public key hash from the TEE report is equal to the hash of the public
//!     key presented in the server response
//!   - It also extracts the TEE measurement from the TEE report and compares it to the expected one
//!   - If the TEE report is not valid, then the Client closes the connection and aborts the
//!     protocol
//! - Client uses its and Server's public keys to generate a symmetric session key, which is shared
//!   between client and server
//! - Client uses the session key to encrypt further requests to the Server
//! - Server uses the session key to decrypt further requests from the Client and encrypt
//!   corresponding responses
//!
//! It's important to note that for each new gRPC stream both Client and Server generate new pairs
//! of private/public key pairs and negotiate new session keys.
//!
//! Key negotiation is done using [`ring::agreement`](https://briansmith.org/rustdoc/ring/agreement/index.html).
//!
//! Note: Current version of the gRPC Attestation Service doesn't have remote attestation.
