# The exact version of the images to pull are specified in /scripts/common .
#
# Here we pull both the exact image pinned in this repository, plus the "latest" image, in case they
# are different, for convenience, though only the pinned one is actually used by the other scripts.
# The "latest" image may still be useful for local editor integration or other local development
# tasks.
