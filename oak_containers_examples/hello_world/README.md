# Hello World v0

This is a simple example showing the shape of an Oak Containers application
deployment. This example has the following properties:

- Uses HPKE for the encryption protocol
- The Streaming Transport session is managed by the host (untrusted) app
- The streaming implementation is implemented manually, not provided by the SDK
- This example uses the "service_streaming" generic service provided by Oak.
